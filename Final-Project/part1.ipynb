Obviously I'm sorry you have such daily physical problems but I'm\\r\\nsure that makes you even happier you did the skydiving when you did. I'm\\r\\nreally pleased what you did worked for you and it's encouraging to find a\\r\\nrare example of someone who has somewhat defeated depression even if the\\r\\ncost of that has been quite extreme.\\r\\n\\r\\n=E2=80=8BBut then on the same hand, not recognising how lucky I am isn't th=\\r\\ne\\r\\nproblem, it's knowing that I am and I'm still not feeling good which then\\r\\nfurther compounds how bad I feel about myself. I know I'm luckier than\\r\\nmost, I know things could be worse, I live in an affluent country with\\r\\nwater on tap, have good health and had a normal upbringing with no major\\r\\ntraumas. So knowing this makes me feel EVEN worse about myself. I see\\r\\nI'm selfish, and ungrateful, and petty and all other words - why can't I\\r\\njust be happy?\\r\\n\\r\\n=E2=80=8BI've put my life on the line a few times, both within the safety c=\\r\\nonfines\\r\\nof organised activities and on the less controlled activities I may do\\r\\nmyself - it doesn't help me.

For you, an=\\r\\nd others\\r\\nit may work. You are obviously an inspiration to lots of people not only\\r\\nfor the physical issues (which are almost a separate issue) but for the\\r\\nfact you have altered your way of thinking in a positive manner. But they\\r\\nalso highlight how everyone's issues are unique - and as well intentioned,\\r\\nand even correct, your view that it could be worse it, that can actually\\r\\nmake people feel worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n=E2=80=8BIf we all focused on 'it could be worse' they'd be very few people=\\r\\n in this\\r\\nworld who could complain, unfortunately it's not that simple. This\\r\\ndepression doesn't care that I'm lucky, it just cares that I think badly of\\r\\nmyelf and reminds me of it every day and actually accelerates when I speak\\r\\nto people who could argue they do have a good reason to feel bad. I know I\\r\\ndon't - and that makes it even worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n=E2=80=8BThanks for your reply, I hope I didn't come across aggressively!

So I'm just leaching...\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends - if you can measure a person by their friends then I'm zero. I\\r\\nmean zero, not one person. My fault, there fault it, it doesn't really\\r\\nmatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth - other than this(!) ok really, standard weight, normal height,\\r\\ndon't smoke, drink or do drugs. Eat reasonably healthily and do sport\\r\\nsporadically when it's either sunny and/or I have a spark of inspiration.\\r\\nTried routines, lasted a week before a bad day threw it all off.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer - down the pooper! Can't return to full time teaching, know I can't\\r\\ndo that. To 'stuck up' for want of a better word to take a shop job knowing\\r\\nI trained to be a teacher. Also can't find another job that is term time\\r\\nonly (to spend time with partner). I'd struggle in ANY job anyway. Too\\r\\noverqualified for most things that might suit purpose. Supply is\\r\\npossibility but that means new people and stuff every day - not my string\\r\\npoint! Plus it means phone calls for availability and I can't talk on\\r\\nphone! Pathetic, whinging, excuse riddled crap eh? Not on benefits or\\r\\nanything as gf is on plentiful wage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooks - awful, have the face of a teenager who can't grow even a hint of a\\r\\nmoustache never mind a beard which means I'm constantly asked for ID (or my\\r\\nparents if a knock at the door) despite being 34!!! People say you should\\r\\nbe flattered but to me it feels like a kick in the face - maybe it's the\\r\\nbloke thing, it's like people telling you you're a child. I almost am a\\r\\nchild... My facial skin is awful too, no creams or regimes suggested by the\\r\\ngirlfriend work so I've just given up. Maybe I'm an expert at giving up!!\\r\\nTo be fair, all things above have been tried for at least 6 months from\\r\\ndrugs to therapy to face cream!\\r\\n\\r\\nI do appreciate your help/advice. I still wonder if it's just character\\r\\nrather than depression. Maybe I'm just a cynical, boring, lonely, ugly\\r\\nloner. That's fine when it's just you, a killer when you feel you're\\r\\nholding others back from a 'proper' life.\\r\\n\"],\n",

You make me feel even more pathetic but that's my issue rather\\r\\nthan yours!! Perspective makes me think even worse of myself as I know I'm\\r\\nlucky compared to lots - so why do I feel like this?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs regards the drug route, a lot of people have suggested this. However one\\r\\nmajor issue stops me and is not really ever talked about - I'm terrified of\\r\\npeople/meetings etc! So I can't see a Doctor! When at my lowest I was being\\r\\nferried around so had no choice and needed a Doctors note etc but now the\\r\\nthought of seeing a Doctor (or any body I know I have to talk to) terrifies\\r\\nme to the point I'd almost have a panic attack. So not sure what to do\\r\\nthere really! Still not convinced on the drug thing anyway - it only made\\r\\nme slightly manic (obsessed with projects) and had no effect on my overall\\r\\nmood at all, well other than making the idea of 'going' seem even more\\r\\nrational.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo instead of me whinging on and on let me just make a few completely\\r\\nuneducated comments regarding your situation. You don't seem depressed so\\r\\nmuch as tired! I don't mean that in a dismissive way but you clearly have a\\r\\nlot on your plate and I think (if there is any) you need some support. I'd\\r\\ngo as far as saying I doubt the drugs are halping you - they seem to be\\r\\ntreating a symptom not a cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you have anxiety before all the pressures you're under? I think you'd\\r\\nfeel a hell of a lot better quicker if you directed your energy to finding\\r\\nfinancial and/or respite support if there is any. You're probably doing too\\r\\nmuch and it's impacting on your health physically and emotionally. If there\\r\\nisn't any further help then, other than shaking your head at the hand\\r\\nyou've been dealt, then you seem to have a good plan of action at the\\r\\nmoment. If that plan could be super organised to include you (as in time\\r\\nfor yourself etc) and maybe incorporate a job (if you so wished) you may\\r\\nfind you were in control a bit more.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not trying to sound dismissive at all I promise! You have a compelling\\r\\nreason to feel the way you do and I acknowledge I'm talking without all the\\r\\nfacts. I just get the sense it's a lack of control on a very hectic/\\r\\nemotional draining life that is you're primary concern. For example, if you\\r\\nwon the lottery and could deal with all the bills and give the care to your\\r\\ndaughter you wish do you think you'd feel infinitely better? You're\\r\\ndepressed because of the situation I think so hopefully either you, or you\\r\\nand others, could plan a route that would help you considerably. I think\\r\\nthere is a lot of hope for you to be VERY happy and enjoy your life with\\r\\nyour daughter but you've just been struggling for years and it's worn you\\r\\ndown.

After your l=\\r\\now-level\\r\\npet has done its duty, switch it out for a higher level pet and proceed to\\r\\nknock out the wild pet(s). Alternately, swap in your low-level pet and then\\r\\nimmediately swap it out (obviously, need to time this just right in pet\\r\\nbattles!).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few items in-game that will increase XP gain of battle pets.\\r\\nThe Safari Hat, obtained by completing the achievement \"Taming the World\",\\r\\nwill increase XP gain of pets by 10%.\\r\\nPet Treats will increase the XP gain by 50% for 1 hour and Lesser Pet\\r\\nTreats increase the XP gain by 25% for 1 hour. All the pet XP boosts stack.\\r\\nPet Treats can drop from Tamer Bags or be purchased with either Celestial\\r\\nCoins at the Timeless Isle or with Pet Charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, periodically there will be \"Bonus Pet XP\" weeks in WoW, where\\r\\nall pets\\' XP gains are doubled. This is a fantastic time to level pets.\\r\\nAgain, all the XP boosts stack.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, there are stones that increase levels (covered a little further\\r\\ndown in this guide).\\r\\n'],\n",

Will\\r\\nwe be able to pet battle each other?*\\r\\nUnfortunately at the current time, Blizzard has made Pet Battles active on\\r\\nonly ONE WoW account per battle.net account. While every WoW account will\\r\\nhave access to Pet Battles (and share pets across accounts), only the first\\r\\naccount to log-in each play session will be able to use the Pet Battles\\r\\nfeatures. The rest of the WoW accounts will find that the Pet Journal is\\r\\nlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are serious about wanting access at the same time on separate WoW\\r\\naccounts, you will need to set-up additional battle.net accounts for each\\r\\nWoW account you want simultaneous Pet Battle access on. The CSF forum (found\\r\\n http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1011699/ ) will better be able to help\\r\\nyou with any questions you have pertaining to moving WoW accounts and all.\\r\\nUnfortunately, removing WoW accounts from a battle.net account means that\\r\\nthe moved WoW account will lose access to the shared pets, mounts, and\\r\\nother BoA privilages (such as heirlooms).\\r\\n'],\n",

       "  ' *What are Pet Battles Stones?*\\r\\nPet Battles Stones are an item added by Blizzard with patch 5.1 that\\r\\nenables you to upgrade the quality of your battle pet. There\\'s two types of\\r\\nstones: one which will upgrade the quality of pets and one that will\\r\\nupgrade the level of pets.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuality upgrades (Battle stones): Flawless Battle stones are rewarded for\\r\\ncompleting some pet quests, can drop from some bosses, can be present in\\r\\ntamer bags, and are available for purchase with either Celestial Coins or\\r\\nPet Charms. There\\'s also Polished Battle stones (but they only upgrade to\\r\\nuncommon and are pretty useless now).\\r\\n\\r\\nLeveling stones (Battle-training stones): Currently, there are family\\r\\nspecific stones (which drop from battles/tamer battles and are also\\r\\navailable for purchase with Pet Charms), Flawless Battle-training stones\\r\\n(which are awarded for completing Menagerie pet quests and available for\\r\\npurchase with Pet Charms), and Fel-touched Battle-Training Stones, which\\r\\naward 5 pet levels and drop from the Fel-Touched Pet Supplies, obtained by\\r\\nbattling the legendary pets in Tanaan Jungle.\\r\\n\\r\\n*How do I obtain Pet Battles Stones?*\\r\\nThere are several ways, depending on the stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolished Battle Stones are sold by Commander Lo Ping in the Niuzao Temple\\r\\nin Townalong Steppes for 1000 JP. Again, these merely upgrade a pet to\\r\\nuncommon and are pretty much a waste of JP. Do not buy these.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can purchase a Marked Flawless Battlestone for 3 Celestial Coins\\r\\nobtained from the Celestial Tournament on the Timeless Isle or at the\\r\\nGarrison Menagerie for 15 Pet Charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamily Battle-training Stones are a *random* drop that you get from\\r\\nbattling wild pets or Pet Tamers. Mostly, wild pets will drop family\\r\\nspecific stones but can drop the general purpose (need to confirm this).\\r\\nAlso, some pets seem to have identity confusion and may drop a different\\r\\nfamily stone. As of 5.4, you can turn 3 family specific stones (ex,\\r\\nFlawless Beast Battle Stone) into one general purpose Flawless Battlestone.\\r\\nFamily battle-training stones are also available for purchase at the\\r\\nGarrison Menagerie in the \"Mystery Bag\" for 2 pet charms (random which\\r\\nfamily(s) you get). Flawless Battle-training stones are also available at\\r\\nthe Garrison for 3 pet charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, once a character has upgraded their Draenor garrison to level\\r\\n3, they are given a quest outside their new Menagerie by either Lio the\\r\\nLioness (Alliance) or Serr\\'ah (Horde) to find a stone outside their\\r\\ngarrison mine. Completing this quest rewards the character with the\\r\\n\"Ultimate Battle-Training Stone\" , which will level any battle pet to 25.\\r\\nThis quest can be done on multiple characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, Battle Stones *may* disappear from your inventory through the\\r\\nmagic of CRZ. If this happens to you, open a ticket to get it restored.\\r\\n\\r\\n*How do I use a Battle Stone?*\\r\\nTo use one of these, you need to summon the pet in question, target it, and\\r\\nthen use the item. Clicking on the pet in the Pet Journal will not do\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n'],\n",

I have a trial account I could try out, but I am\\r\\ncurrently at work without access.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it's been reported that pets are b.net bound, so they *should* be\\r\\nsharable.

       "  \" Wow...just wow...This game is crazy. And huge. So freaking huge!\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm 20 hours in and I'm still getting lost on these Titans. Here's my\\r\\nbreakdown of Xenoblade Chronicles 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, this game is not for those who want something they can play in very\\r\\nsmall chunks. It is a pretty deep JRPG and requires/seizures your attention\\r\\nfor long periods of time. To get the most from this title you must devote\\r\\nsome time to learning it's ins and outs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of the first 10+ hours, you're going to have information\\r\\nfeed to you. Most importantly, those involving combat. Clicking through\\r\\nthese tutoriorls because you think you understand will result in you\\r\\npromptly being destroyed by your enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world of Alrest feels as though it is literally seeking your utter\\r\\ndestruction for any and every failure. Time attacks incorrectly and you may\\r\\nleave your foe with just enough life to lay down a world of hurt upon you.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding combat: It's superb. The learning curve can be steep though. You\\r\\nhave such a wealth of options at your diposal that it can overwhelm you.\\r\\nElements, weapons, directional stances, etc....your mind will be working\\r\\novertime to figure out what your next step in battlefield should be and you\\r\\ndon't have very long to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nXenoblade fights require you to be not just quick thinking, but divisive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe HUD during combat is another aspect that can be a bit much. Especially\\r\\nif you were again, the type of person to ignore the tutorials. It is\\r\\ninformation overload.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch your parties health, watch you characters auto attack timing, watch\\r\\nyou special abilities, watch your enemies attacks, watch for status changes\\r\\nin the enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour eyes need to be trained to take this all in and be able to act upon it\\r\\nin an instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of damage you can deliver is huge if you are prepared. It can\\r\\ngreatly reduced the amount of time your fighting an opponent.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombat is something that Xenoblade does very well. It makes you feel like a\\r\\npro when you successfully bring down a for due to your skill. Something you\\r\\ndon't always get from a game.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext up is exploration.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the world of Xenoblade is humongous! It makes the\\r\\nland of Hyrule in BotW look downright bleak and empty. Towns are full of\\r\\npeople and feel alive with activity. So many shops to spend your money on\\r\\nto prepare for combat. Numerous NPCs to speak with to not only learn about\\r\\nthis world, but also what's happening in it and actually advancing it's\\r\\nabilities to assist you later.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside of the towns, the landscape is simply beautiful. The areas vary\\r\\ngreatly from lush jungles to sandy deserts. Branching paths usually reward\\r\\nyou for simply exploring.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while the towns and landscapes are wonderful, the guiding arrow to\\r\\ncomplete missions is borderline a deal breaker. Seriously, this thing is\\r\\nuseless unless your on a level area. Alrest is wide, tall and full of nooks\\r\\nand crannies. If you aren't up for looking behind every corner, checking\\r\\nevery hole, you'll miss you stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy advice: You better listen to whoever is giving you an assignment because\\r\\nsimply following the arrow at the top of the HUD will drive you insane.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the story. I won't spoil anything here, but I will say that it's\\r\\nvery good so far. Probably not the deepest thing out there, but certainly\\r\\nentertaining. Leans heavily into ideas and mannerisms found in many\\r\\nJapanese mangas. If you like those things, you throughly enjoy yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up, I'd say this game is certainly worth the price of admission.\\r\\nZelda kicked off the Switch launch properly, and Xenoblade is giving the\\r\\nhuge assist to finish off Nintendo's efforts in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nXenoblade has kicked my tail to the point that sometimes I want to just put\\r\\nthe controller down. But those times I successfully pull off a combo of\\r\\nepic proportions...it just reels me back in.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, what do you all think of XC2?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's discuss below!\\r\\n\"],\n",

How weird is this though; I didn't think I had paranoia but\\r\\nyou almost sound like my little sister! I know you're not, but in my head\\r\\nI'm beginning to wonder whether I should write on here!\\r\\n\\r\\nI probably do have depression, I acknowledge that. I think my personality\\r\\nmight not help but I agree, depression is likely. I have social anxiety, I\\r\\nover think far too much, I have mild symptoms of OCD, I have some body\\r\\nissues, I hide my trichotillomania well being male (face) and I'm somewhat\\r\\nof a perfectionist or idealist - if I could have done it better then it was\\r\\ncrap.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetically speaking there doesn't seem to be any history of it in my\\r\\nfamily. Because of the way my last job blew up, my parents became more\\r\\naware of the situation. That's not to say they were completely blind to it,\\r\\nbut it became more of a discussion. My parents have both had depression due\\r\\nto work but were fine before and after the event that caused it (tribunals\\r\\netc) but they don't really understand the 'lack of reason' side of it. I\\r\\nshared with them for a while, on both ups and downs, but got the impression\\r\\nit was upsetting them so have largely stopped talking about it. I never\\r\\nmentioned suicide to them. Again, due to the situation my older sister\\r\\nbecame aware and she too pressed a little but there is a limit you want to\\r\\ntalk about things when all it does is upset people and they can't help you\\r\\nanyway. I have not talked about it with other family members. I'm already\\r\\nknown as the depressing one, so I try to sound super happy when I'm around\\r\\nfamily now. I was told that the reason I'm, at least subconciously, left\\r\\nout in family gatherings is because I'm quiet/ serious/ boring (actual\\r\\nterms!). I'm aware they'd care if I wasn't here - most people are\\r\\ngenetically programmed to protect their kin, but my absence would make no\\r\\ndifference really. I now spend Xmas away from family, I'm fairly sure\\r\\nthey're happier for it! I hate being a chore. I love your statement about\\r\\nit being 'disgusting sweet s*t' - that's so very much my style, even in the\\r\\ndepths it's very much black humour, sarcasm etc - struggle with sweet stuff!\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside my family there is just my girlfriend. That sounds extreme, but\\r\\nit's really not. I don't have a single other friend, that is equally my\\r\\nfault. But I talk to no one from University days, no ex colleagues etc. I\\r\\nknow no-one else. Partially I like it that way, it's easy and I don't feel\\r\\nlike a burden, on the other hand I feel like some of them could have fought\\r\\nto 'look after me' - they all gave up very easily. I know that's not fair.\\r\\nYou shouldn't test your friends. But on the other hand, if I really cared\\r\\nfor someone and knew they were struggling emotionally, I'd put in a little\\r\\nmore effort. I wasn't ever mean or snappy with them, I just kind of\\r\\ndisappeared. But it's not their job to understand mental issues, they have\\r\\ntheir own busy lives with their own problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I sometimes speak to my girlfriend, less so these days though. When it\\r\\nall hit the fan I had no choice but to share everything with her, not that\\r\\nit was brand new information of anything - I've been with her for a long\\r\\ntime. But maybe the intensity of the feelings was new, of the fact they\\r\\nwere always there. But again, there's very little she can do so why depress\\r\\nher. I don't want to see her cry because of me. So I've largely stopped\\r\\ntalking about things, in a way that might give her the impression I'm\\r\\nimproving. Occasionally stuff slips out, or I sarcastically mention\\r\\n'leaving' but I cover it well now. I still tell her to find someone else, I\\r\\ncover it in a light/jokey way but, although I'm not stupid and I know she\\r\\nsees though it, it is kind of an acceptable level of sharing.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou're right about social anxiety too. That I fully recognise. I care way\\r\\nmore than I should, or want to, about others thoughts. Doesn't stop it\\r\\nthough. I do analyse everything I've said and done before and after events\\r\\nbut I can't forget it - really stupid example; I still remember saying\\r\\nsomething that was taken the mick out of at school, probably really mildly,\\r\\nand that was about twenty five years ago! How the hell can I get over this\\r\\nwhen I still stew over stuff I said when I was 9?!\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite seeing every flaw in myself I don't take criticism well, not in a\\r\\ngrumpy way but in a defeatest way. If I'm told a million things are good\\r\\nbut 'this' needs improving then it was an awful experience. I know that is\\r\\nboth ridiculous and common but want it stop effecting me so much. In\\r\\ncomplete contrast I am very patient and forgiving of others, I'll always\\r\\nsee the other side of the argument and I'll happily give people as much\\r\\ntime as they need. I'm the epitomy of 'do as I say, not as I do!'. I know\\r\\nwhere I'm going wrong, I know my thought processes are messed up, but I\\r\\njust don't know how to fix them. I can't think of many situations where\\r\\nI've felt 'better' than anyone else - the closest I get it wondering why\\r\\nhorrible people in this world are more likely to succeed; stupidity is\\r\\nrewarded (TOWIE type), rudeness is applauded (Cowell), stabbing people in\\r\\nthe back is relabled 'ambition', and generous people get walked on and\\r\\ncriminals win the lottery!\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm really happy you've started to figure your life out. You sound very\\r\\nintelligent and in control. You also mentioned being in school so I suspect\\r\\nyou are quite young; for you to have such a good grip on your feelings and\\r\\nrecognise triggers and mental health issues is quite impressive. Is it an\\r\\navenue you have interest in? I'm genuinely happy you have got such a grip\\r\\non it early, understanding it early may help you in the long run - I don't\\r\\nknow, but I suspect the longer this is left the harder it is to undo the\\r\\n'learning to hate yourself' that is embedded in to you.

So currently Ive quit my job as a teacher couldnt take it always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you youre useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I dont think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt Id let everyone down so disappeared my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough put me on medication which seemed to do very little even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like its doing nothing at all either we talk Im honest as I can be but there is some element of being public and putting on that face/ jokey responses. I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my theories are proved.

I know my family and gf love me but time heals life would get better and people move on. In the long run Im sure it wouldnt effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.

       "  'What a fantastic answer but also a really bad one!! Let me explain... Firstly Im very pleased to see you are happy and treat every day as a gift. Obviously Im sorry you have such daily physical problems but Im sure that makes you even happier you did the skydiving when you did. Im really pleased what you did worked for you and its encouraging to find a rare example of someone who has somewhat defeated depression even if the cost of that has been quite extreme. But then on the same hand not recognising how lucky I am isnt th e problem its knowing that I am and Im still not feeling good which then further compounds how bad I feel about myself. I know Im luckier than most I know things could be worse I live in an affluent country with water on tap have good health and had a normal upbringing with no major traumas. So knowing this makes me feel EVEN worse about myself. I see Im selfish and ungrateful and petty and all other words why cant I just be happy? Ive put my life on the line a few times both within the safety c onfines of organised activities and on the less controlled activities I may do myself it doesnt help me. Being near death doesnt impact me positively or negatively Im almost apathetic to it. And this is why your answer is both fantastic and bad! For you an d others it may work. You are obviously an inspiration to lots of people not only for the physical issues (which are almost a separate issue) but for the fact you have altered your way of thinking in a positive manner. But they also highlight how everyones issues are unique and as well intentioned and even correct your view that it could be worse it that can actually make people feel worse. If we all focused on it could be worse theyd be very few people in this world who could complain unfortunately its not that simple. This depression doesnt care that Im lucky it just cares that I think badly of myelf and reminds me of it every day and actually accelerates when I speak to people who could argue they do have a good reason to feel bad. I know I dont and that makes it even worse. Thanks for your reply I hope I didnt come across aggressively! I m very happy that you are happy and hope things improve if thats possible for you. Good luck have a great Christmas and a lovely New Year.'],\n",

I wish I could talk to you more directly than on an open forum. I ve said before knowledge is a great thing but it can also be a curse. You need to be particuarly careful selfdiagnosing but also need to think whether this diagnosis is in any way helpful to you. Say you decide that you are HFAS how does that help you? If you cant source help then it is just another meaningless semantic for feeling awful day to day. Ive also mentioned that it is probably important to get outside y our own head think about doing things that stop you thinking about yourself. However as a caveat I also recognise doing anything (like talking to another human being as you rightly point out!) can be extrememly stressful. Id never pick holes in others punctuation and grammar unless they were doing it to others! Its a forum not a thesis! However if you have the time and pride to check your message back then maybe you do have the time to look at HFAS if it interests you. To be honest knowledge is something I despise yet am addicted to so I will inevitably be searching HFSA after Ive written this reply! But without an argument or focus it is impossible to really research a topic to any purpose. I will happily help others if I can (preferably from afar!) but not sure what I could do to focus your research on this matter and whether itd even be of any benefit to you anyway. Like I said there is certainly an interesting discussion to be ha d but unfortunately I doubt this is the place to do it effectively for you or I. Good Luck.'],\n",

       "  'Quick research scan read. Told you I would... I definitely dont have HFSA. You may well have but itd take more than a quick chat to establish that. As Im sure youre aware everyone is somewhere on the autistic sp ectrum and all the various labels that spin off that. Even the most normal of people might feel particuarly calmed by a colour or get irritated by a simple tapping noise. The issues arise when your quirks impact on your life. Mine do for me and yours sound like they do for you. I have had a ton of labels I have both researched or been told abo ut that might fit my ways of thinking and acting but the conclusion I reached was that it was all kind of pointless a label by its very nature is just a broad title to fit many people and when that comes to the brain its a very pointless exercise. You might be able to group broken limbs in patients but with the head its nearly impossible theres too many bits that do or dont apply for every individual. Ultimately a title is only helpful to point you in the right direction to get you personalised help. And it HAS to be personalised. I think I have depression with social anxiety. I have signs of bi polar I get symptoms of SAD I have trichotillomania I have mild OCD that gets worse if Im stressed I have panic attacks I over think everything I have low selfesteem and no confidence I feel suicidal most days and a million other minilabels. Doesnt help me though. Its the classic whats in a name? I hope you see my point. We sound very similar yet I would class m yself as a people pleaser I rarely sure emotion outside the house and am overly polite to even strangers. So whilst HFSA might apply in parts it doesnt solve everything. Think about what you want from this title. How will it help you? Y ou might be better focusing on the things that make you feel better not labelling something that makes you feel bad. Good luck.'],\n",

I dont even know how to be happy and feel I should leave those around me before I drag them down too! If you feel lonely then be a little more proactive join some clubs or groups etc. Without being offensive you are a little older than me and there are a lot more clubs set up for your age group than mine that wouldnt be intimidating. I get expectations of sports clubs (loud bravado people!) or nightclubs etc where as Im sure there are more suitable groups for you. Knowing what you want to make you happy is a great thing. As for your family you seem to want nothing to do with them. Great! Sorry people on here may say thats sad etc or to try but its your situation if you simply dont get on then absolutely forget them. People survive without families all the time. Or you mentioned the recluse maybe you need each other... I sympathise in case that didnt come across so whilst I appreciate I have one on you by having a partner (although that can make you feel worse by the way in that you feel like a burden) you also have one on me knowing what will make you happy.

Going to Australia in the first place is quite an acheivement and you must be doing something right! I too only really get enjoyment from helping others the issue comes that when that problem is solved I feel of no use and begin to withdraw. I have done it with friends and family. My girlfriend is a case in point she had relationship financial and work issues and I helped her solve all of these to be in a better place to the point now she considers everything to be pretty good in those departments but I have nothing left to offer her. Worse still I am now only going to be a burdn on her financially and emotionally and can offer her no decent future prospects. All that swims in my head is \"if you love them let them go\" as staying with her seems very selfish. However she is the first person who I have ever really shared this with. My past relationships completed the cycle! She understands as much as one can and is very supportive but I feel that her patience must run out eventually (shes a teacher so she does have a lot!) and she shouldnt have to deal with this anyway. If I were you Id visit America. Not sure where youre going but if you have the means then do it. If nothing else it is something to look back on one day and think wow I did that and gives you that ton more of info to talk about with friends strangers future partners that can fill those awkward moments when youre not sure what to say! Youve lived abroad nearly everyone would say thats pretty cool! Cheers for the offer of a drink ha ha! But Im so crap Id probably just put it off and hope to be left alone!

Ive never felt hard done by or unfortunate my problems are me! However youre right there is an element of fanning the flames! The reason Ive largely stopped looking at this site is I dont see a benefit for me or anyone else. I recognise some may get comfort from support from like minded people or signposted to suitable resources or recognise symptoms of PTS or similar but for me all I read is people who live with it forever with no answers and that in itself is depressing. People say knowledge is power but I find it to be a curse. The more you know the more you realise your insignificance the hopelessness of situations and the reality of the world rather than the rosetinted itll all work out in the end view were told to believe. I really struggle with the inability of professionals to accept that some people dont succeed some people do fail some people arent talented some people arent nice why cant that be me? Its no different than saying \"it cant happen to me\". So for that reason Im very much keeping this site at arms length.

Unfortunately I doubt I will either give you insightful answers or even a nice positive slant on my response you have been warned! Little has changed. I tried drugs didnt work I tried therapy too much religion and not willing to try again a weird catch 22 in where you need to ask for help but are afraid of talking to people even day to day. Friends are nonexistent I quit my job and havent returned. I still feel like a burden to those around me and how ever much they care it doesnt excuse it in fact it makes it worse. I cant escape feeling that if I was a good person then Id protect them from me if you were highly infectious with a deadly disease would you hug your family?

One day its just me and there is no hope next day its wont please someone give me a magic wand (but I wont ask!). If I seem ungrateful with any responses then that wasnt my intention maybe its my way I always focus on negative and all I see is lots of people struggling and noone coming out the other side. It feels like the blind leading the blind. Further more most people seem to have a good reason through circumstance or substance abuse or dramas in their life Im just like this for no real reason. Pretty pathetic really. My girlfriend does support me but it both helps me survive and yet stops me facing my issues and makes me feel not good enough and as if Im holding her back. I know she doesnt feel that but I feel like it MUST or it will eventually when she realises what shell miss out on. Cycles of mood are continuous but rarely hit a positive slant some days Im just ok and potter around and others I feel the strongest urge to give up. The only trigger I know doesnt help (but isnt crucial) is the weather but thats common with lots of people. A bad day will turn in to a bed day easily if its grey! Lucky I live in UK Ive tried improvements in diet etc but Im not exactly a bad eater anyway exercise is fine but doesnt really change anything just gives me something to do. Easily lose will to do it though. My socialising is obviously nonexistent and I try to encourage girlfriend to do her own thing with friends in that respect. So in summary nothings changed Im in a state of status quo every plan I come up with I find a major flaw in I strongly doubt theres a way out I hate the way I look sound and feel and feel I should protect people from their own blinkered love.

Cant return to full time teaching know I cant do that. To stuck up for want of a better word to take a shop job knowing I trained to be a teacher. Also cant find another job that is term time only (to spend time with partner). Id struggle in ANY job anyway. Too overqualified for most things that might suit purpose.

Not on benefits or anything as gf is on plentiful wage.

People say you should be flattered but to me it feels like a kick in the face maybe its the bloke thing its like people telling you youre a child. I almost am a child... My facial skin is awful too no creams or regimes suggested by the girlfriend work so Ive just given up. Maybe Im an expert at giving up!! To be fair all things above have been tried for at least 6 months from drugs to therapy to face cream! I do appreciate your help/advice. I still wonder if its just character rather than depression.

You make me feel even more pathetic but thats my issue rather than yours!! Perspective makes me think even worse of myself as I know Im lucky compared to lots so why do I feel like this? As regards the drug route a lot of people have suggested this. However one major issue stops me and is not really ever talked about Im terrified of people/meetings etc! So I cant see a Doctor! When at my lowest I was being ferried around so had no choice and needed a Doctors note etc but now the thought of seeing a Doctor (or any body I know I have to talk to) terrifies me to the point Id almost have a panic attack. So not sure what to do there really! Still not convinced on the drug thing anyway it only made me slightly manic (obsessed with projects) and had no effect on my overall mood at all well other than making the idea of going seem even more rational. So instead of me whinging on and on let me just make a few completely uneducated comments regarding your situation. You dont seem depressed so much as tired! I dont mean that in a dismissive way but you clearly have a lot on your plate and I think (if there is any) you need some support. Id go as far as saying I doubt the drugs are halping you they seem to be treating a symptom not a cause. Did you have anxiety before all the pressures youre under? I think youd feel a hell of a lot better quicker if you directed your energy to finding financial and/or respite support if there is any. Youre probably doing too much and its impacting on your health physically and emotionally. If there isnt any further help then other than shaking your head at the hand youve been dealt then you seem to have a good plan of action at the moment. If that plan could be super organised to include you (as in time for yourself etc) and maybe incorporate a job (if you so wished) you may find you were in control a bit more. Im not trying to sound dismissive at all I promise! You have a compelling reason to feel the way you do and I acknowledge Im talking without all the facts. I just get the sense its a lack of control on a very hectic/ emotional draining life that is youre primary concern. For example if you won the lottery and could deal with all the bills and give the care to your daughter you wish do you think youd feel infinitely better? Youre depressed because of the situation I think so hopefully either you or you and others could plan a route that would help you considerably. I think there is a lot of hope for you to be VERY happy and enjoy your life with your daughter but youve just been struggling for years and its worn you down. Asking for help (other than medicinal) is the right way to go.'],\n",

I too have multiple issues with religion (thats a real rant!) but I dont think anyone has the right to judge another. I would never judge anyone else as worthless but I know myself and can judge myself. I stand by that judgement based on what I know what I do what I think and the proof I have. A person suffering from anorexia will ignore the scales reading too low a weight I suffer from no dilusions. Everything points to me being everything I think I am.

Another words whilst I offer my opinion on a particular though process it doesnt mean Ive not actually gone far beyond that in my own thinking. So to answer your very well thoughout view it is all stuff I have thought of before and almost counted out! Im just a whiner obviously If I did what I want Id be sportsman but then we have to be realistic and say that isnt going to bring in any wage! Besides I also know I struggle in team situations in reality as I struggle with the bravado that is especially prevalent in male sports. So what else do I enjoy genuinely nothing. But even I recognise that might be an extension of my apathy. Teaching is fun I love working with kids... but the other teachers parents Ofsted paperwork and most constant judgement of any career makes it impossible. On a side note if you have any issues with self confidence teaching is NOT the way to go! Ive never known a career in which youre so reguarly scutinised and theres always something you could have done better and if youre of a fragile nature you naturally only focus on that. No jobs dont have to be people based I too have worked in media as a journalist (although that is people based!) but cant think of anything Id enjoy or more pertinently be able to do skill time or wage wise! Setting up a cattery would be nice but need money for that. Being an architect always appealed by I have neither the time (course duration) or the skills to do it! Im not sure if this is normal or not I struggle with people but also struggle alone. Its not like once I have escaped people I feel relaxed. Maybe Im in a sydrome called grass is always greener! When left alone I am even more self destructive in my thoughts thinking time is not good time. I do appreciate you saying maybe there isnt anything you massively excel in its those kind of statements that make me think people are writing realistically rather than using a softly softly approach. Its not like negatives are the only reality but I can only begin to believe a statement if people acknowledge the bad. People saying \"Im sure youre good at x\" just makes me turn off someone saying \"Ok youre crap at that BUT try....\" is much more realistic. Unfortunately I havent found the good thing! I know that youd be better off is an extremely frustrating statement. The question is do you reveal what youre thinking or keep it to yourself? I always say be careful what you ask or you might not like the answer but if Im being asked to open up and not bottle feelings then where is the line on what is acceptable to share and what isnt? I cant help very strongly feeling that. I do think time heals and it seems logical to reduce any pain to its minimum a year or so after Im gone or a lifetime of regrets missed opportunities and struggles with me around. I cant do the whole marriage kids thing. I am next to useless when it comes to mortgages and luxuries. We all start with dreams of being rich and famous and having everything we want we then give up certain dreams as childhood subsides and reality kicks in as we get older we give up more and more dreams as we cant achieve them. But once youve given up every dream dont you just fade away? A very old person knows they will not travel the world again they know they can not look like a 30 year old movie star their wish may be to see a grandchild go to university or even simply to reach 100. But once youve done everything you can do or know you will ever do then to me it feels like its time to go. I tried the meds ok only once but it didnt work. I cant face going back to the doctors again and having to talk about all this. It feel so pathetic talking to a grown man about my piddly stupid head. Theres people going in there with proper problems or at least fixable ones! Am I afraid of death? Not really the thought of it is very much in my head. And I mean the actual thought not the before or the after the thought of that last breath then nothing. I dont think greatly of the drama of after a death (like oh people will miss me etc etc) I just am transfixed on the thought of that very last spark of the brain. It will come one day. Whilst Im very careful not to talk about suicide on here (gone or left being much friendlier terms) I know Id never make me passing traumatic for train divers dog walkers or unsuspecting family members. Bungeejumping skydiving or Vegas all sound great. But thats where the reality sets in how exactly am I paying for this?! If there was one thing that I think would have the greatest impact on my mental health itd be winning the lottery I could then distract myself with things or feel like I was providing for my family. Id still have those demons Id still avoid people Id still have no friends etc but instead of stewing Id be being kept busy on a beach in Hawaii! Money doesnt solve everything but it makes the low points easier to deal with as you can more readily escape. I do love travel that being said and when ever I can afford it I do. Im never going to feel differently to the way I do... thats as far as Im willing to agree with your last statement! Ive actually tried the big changes Ive tried doing the things that scare me or out of my comfort zone. I went to University alone along way away from family I travelled Europe camping for a summer I took on jobs I didnt think I could do I moved to new areas with no contacts. I think Ive done everything Im supposed to improve myself and my thinking. But none of it worked all of is (possibly selfinflicted) failed I always reverted to type. I appreciate everyone on here giving their time to convince me otherwise. I have never doubted there are very nice people in this world just as there are horrible ones. I do believe the horrible ones get a better life but thats a different conversation. But Im beginning to find that me answering these views is just making me more sure Im right Im a hopeless case. Whether its depression anxiety personality whining my fault others fault luck or time it now kind of strikes me as irrelevant. Im at this destination there are no more stops.'],\n",

I dont think its the lack of doing anything that causes this however Im still better than when I was at work/ socialising but then if this is the best it gets... well. I have visitied the Doctor and for the record he was really nice. Very supportive in fact. But it didnt change the fact I felt stupid and as if I was wasting his and others time. I remember being really worked up about the fact our appointment slot was overunning because I felt like I was holiding up other people. But I did that because my girlfriend was with me at all times (and forced me!) and because I needed to get a Doctors note for work. Now I no longer work I no longer need to waste peoples time. But youre right Im an expert in giving up! The girlfriend question comment is a difficult one and the one I battle every day more than anything else. If I leave her there is nowhere to go that really is it. I mean that in the practical sense here house etc but also it means that really is the end. I stay through her appeals and for maybe that ounce of hope that she and others are right that itll pass. Although Ive always been like this. Im not staying with her for ease or to string her along but leaving her really is a final decision I have no belief there is something better than her. Probably makes no sense. The 1% hope keeps me alive therefore the 1% keeps me here. If I lose the here I have absolutely zero interest in the alive. I really do appreciate your replies a constructive kick is better than a compassionate hug for me. But I cant find that kick that I cant talk my way around or explain away. I hate my head! I have actually tried everything Im supposed to maybe not for long enough but Ive seen zero difference. Leaving work calmed me down and made me able to uncurl from a ball but does that mean I can never return to a job? That then creates different problems emotionally and financially. I saw the CBT guy but nice as he was he tried a religious route with me (never going to work) and I put on my fake chatty character for the hour even if I was tired afterwards. It didnt do anything. Even if I try to get refered again by the Doctor Id actually be scared that Id be seeing him again or be seen to have asked not for him and although Im fairly sure he wouldnt care it genuinely freaks me out! How messed up is that?! Im actually ok if I prepare well for an hour or so around people I can seem easy going and chatty any longer than that and it gets difficult. If I cant prepare i.e. I know there will be questions Im not expecting or its someone I feel who will judge me e.g. a car mechanic as a guy then I cant do it. How silly is this I still get uneasy surrounded by teenage girls! Im not in the remotest bit interested in them obviously but just the feeling of inadequacy/ that Im a loser makes me feel weird. Same with family there is a duration before it gets too personal I can feel myself being overly happy and lively around them as if its all pouring out on first meeting them but that there is a finite amount and then my energy drops and I disappear.

Having the Terrible Turnip or Molten Corgi as one of your capture pets makes this a little easier as these pets have an ability that will never kill. You can progress towards better traps by raising battle pets to level 25. The Pristine Trap is the best trap in game and is earned by completing the \"Pro Pet Crew\" achievement. The Draenic Trap which only works in Draenor is obtained by leveling your Garrison Pet Menagerie to level 2. Special note: occasionally in the wild youll see that an additional pet(s) has joined the battle. If youre looking to capture more pets pay attention to the quality of both pets youre fighting (the additional pets portrait will display smaller next to the pet youre currently fighting).

Level 25 pets and pets that are 5+ levels above the enemy pet receive no experience for that battle although they do count when experience is split (as long as they are alive at the end of the battle). A \"difficulty bonus\" is given to pets that survive a battle under certain conditions. First if a pet is 2+ levels below the level of the enemy pet they generally receive the difficulty bonus. Also if a pet at or below the level of the enemy pets manages to solo a multipet team or 2 pets of equal or lower level take on a 3pet team they will receive a difficulty bonus.

How do I change what skills it can use in battle? * In the pet journal add the pet whose moves you want to change to your team (if they arent already on your current team).

One Pokemon standard is to start the fight with a lowlevel pet you wish to powerlevel against higher level pets. That pet must perform an action in order to credit merely having it out does not count. After your l owlevel pet has done its duty switch it out for a higher level pet and proceed to knock out the wild pet(s). Alternately swap in your lowlevel pet and then immediately swap it out (obviously need to time this just right in pet battles!). There are a few items ingame that will increase XP gain of battle pets. The Safari Hat obtained by completing the achievement \"Taming the World\" will increase XP gain of pets by 10%. Pet Treats will increase the XP gain by 50% for 1 hour and Lesser Pet Treats increase the XP gain by 25% for 1 hour. All the pet XP boosts stack. Pet Treats can drop from Tamer Bags or be purchased with either Celestial Coins at the Timeless Isle or with Pet Charms. Additionally periodically there will be \"Bonus Pet XP\" weeks in WoW where all pets XP gains are doubled. This is a fantastic time to level pets. Again all the XP boosts stack.

       "  '*What are Pet Battles Stones?* Pet Battles Stones are an item added by Blizzard with patch 5.1 that enables you to upgrade the quality of your battle pet. Theres two types of stones: one which will upgrade the quality of pets and one that will upgrade the level of pets. Quality upgrades (Battle stones): Flawless Battle stones are rewarded for completing some pet quests can drop from some bosses can be present in tamer bags and are available for purchase with either Celestial Coins or Pet Charms. Theres also Polished Battle stones (but they only upgrade to uncommon and are pretty useless now). Leveling stones (Battletraining stones): Currently there are family specific stones (which drop from battles/tamer battles and are also available for purchase with Pet Charms) Flawless Battletraining stones (which are awarded for completing Menagerie pet quests and available for purchase with Pet Charms) and Feltouched BattleTraining Stones which award 5 pet levels and drop from the FelTouched Pet Supplies obtained by battling the legendary pets in Tanaan Jungle. *How do I obtain Pet Battles Stones?* There are several ways depending on the stone. Polished Battle Stones are sold by Commander Lo Ping in the Niuzao Temple in Townalong Steppes for 1000 JP. Again these merely upgrade a pet to uncommon and are pretty much a waste of JP. Do not buy these. You can purchase a Marked Flawless Battlestone for 3 Celestial Coins obtained from the Celestial Tournament on the Timeless Isle or at the Garrison Menagerie for 15 Pet Charms. Family Battletraining Stones are a *random* drop that you get from battling wild pets or Pet Tamers. Mostly wild pets will drop family specific stones but can drop the general purpose (need to confirm this). Also some pets seem to have identity confusion and may drop a different family stone. As of 5.4 you can turn 3 family specific stones (ex Flawless Beast Battle Stone) into one general purpose Flawless Battlestone. Family battletraining stones are also available for purchase at the Garrison Menagerie in the \"Mystery Bag\" for 2 pet charms (random which family(s) you get). Flawless Battletraining stones are also available at the Garrison for 3 pet charms. Additionally once a character has upgraded their Draenor garrison to level 3 they are given a quest outside their new Menagerie by either Lio the Lioness (Alliance) or Serrah (Horde) to find a stone outside their garrison mine. Completing this quest rewards the character with the \"Ultimate BattleTraining Stone\" which will level any battle pet to 25. This quest can be done on multiple characters. Currently Battle Stones *may* disappear from your inventory through the magic of CRZ. If this happens to you open a ticket to get it restored. *How do I use a Battle Stone?* To use one of these you need to summon the pet in question target it and then use the item. Clicking on the pet in the Pet Journal will not do anything.'],\n",

However its been reported that pets are b.net bound so they *should* be sharable. If you can you can test this by setting up a freetoplay/endless trial account and seeing if that account has access to your current pets. If this works RaF should work as well then. If theyre not there are several possible solutions depending on what Horde specific pets you need. Do you need just the Argent Gruntling Horde balloon and Horde guild pets? You can roll a DK on another server (since they start out at higher level) and do your thing to get the pets you need. Alternatively you can...pay to faction switch one of your current toons and find a Horde guild on your current server to fit your needs. Given the cost of RaF (base account + 2 months of game time) this would probably even out to cost the same. I know the above are not the answers youre looking for but they do exist as solutions. If you do figure out an answer please report back!'],\n",

When the battle is over and the XP flashes aboves each pets head it should have this bonus XP built in. For example Ill have one pet get 49 XP and the other pet get 194 XP with the difficulty bonus (note: that XP reflects the bonus xp being added in its not the typical XP plus that number). Keep in mind that the XP is still split amongst your surviving pets that participated in the battle. Are you not getting the proper amount of XP? Was it possible you were adding the numbers wrong?

Yet something was bothering me and the latest claim against Aziz really brings up an issue: https://babe.net/2018/01/13/azizansari28355 I then read this article: https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/thehumiliationofazizansari/550541/ ....... I want to be completely honest. All the accounts in the #MeToo movement arent the same. And this particular story against Aziz is a bit of a tipping point that Im afraid may begin to hurt the entire movement. It seems as though we have people jumping on the symbolic bandwagon. While people should be fully held responsible for their foul assualting actions but what about inaction? During the Weinstein saga like many I was dumbfounded. How could so many women have been lead into these situations. Yet as I researched a bit more it turns out that many women now famous from their associations with Weinstein knew full well that other young aspiring actresses were walking into the same trap. And I think that disgusted me just as much. Why would you allow other women to be subjected to the same foul treatment? Certainly you would mention to your neighbors and friends if you knew a pedophile were lurking nearby! This is just as terrible. Turns out some women in Hollywood had indeed voiced their experiences but were mostly ignored. Yet the important part was that they had voiced it in the public! Some put out a warning. Again I want to be clear: This in no way brushes aside the actions of men who misuse their celebrity or power to gain what they want. But I can shake the feeling that standing there and taking it....is strange. And bordering on stupid. There are plenty of women around the world who simply wouldnt stand around for this behaviour. My sisters wife and numerous female friends are equally stunned by these situations. Going to meet strange men alone at night standing around while men masterbate in front of them... Why? Is your potential career more important than your dignity or respect? I dont believe any men is these forums would absolve another man of this behaviour. But those of you with daughters certainly youve trained your girls that this is unacceptable and they should immediately leave run or flee if they encounter unwanted sexual advances. My daughter is 4yrs old and my wife and I have already discussed and continue to discuss with her that no one should touch her in certain places. What decent parent hasnt? Yet what is happening when people grow older? Some obviously retain these lessons. Others seem to be ignoring it. Ive always believed that when a situation is in your control you need to take responsibility for what follows. Because in life there are going to be many instances where you dont have control.

       "  'Wow...just wow...This game is crazy. And huge. So freaking huge! Im 20 hours in and Im still getting lost on these Titans. Heres my breakdown of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. First this game is not for those who want something they can play in very small chunks. It is a pretty deep JRPG and requires/seizures your attention for long periods of time. To get the most from this title you must devote some time to learning its ins and outs. Over the course of the first 10+ hours youre going to have information feed to you. Most importantly those involving combat. Clicking through these tutoriorls because you think you understand will result in you promptly being destroyed by your enemies. The world of Alrest feels as though it is literally seeking your utter destruction for any and every failure. Time attacks incorrectly and you may leave your foe with just enough life to lay down a world of hurt upon you. Regarding combat: Its superb. The learning curve can be steep though. You have such a wealth of options at your diposal that it can overwhelm you. Elements weapons directional stances etc....your mind will be working overtime to figure out what your next step in battlefield should be and you dont have very long to decide. Xenoblade fights require you to be not just quick thinking but divisive. The HUD during combat is another aspect that can be a bit much. Especially if you were again the type of person to ignore the tutorials. It is information overload. Watch your parties health watch you characters auto attack timing watch you special abilities watch your enemies attacks watch for status changes in the enemies. Your eyes need to be trained to take this all in and be able to act upon it in an instance. The amount of damage you can deliver is huge if you are prepared. It can greatly reduced the amount of time your fighting an opponent. Combat is something that Xenoblade does very well. It makes you feel like a pro when you successfully bring down a for due to your skill. Something you dont always get from a game. Next up is exploration. As I mentioned earlier the world of Xenoblade is humongous! It makes the land of Hyrule in BotW look downright bleak and empty. Towns are full of people and feel alive with activity. So many shops to spend your money on to prepare for combat. Numerous NPCs to speak with to not only learn about this world but also whats happening in it and actually advancing its abilities to assist you later. Outside of the towns the landscape is simply beautiful. The areas vary greatly from lush jungles to sandy deserts. Branching paths usually reward you for simply exploring. But while the towns and landscapes are wonderful the guiding arrow to complete missions is borderline a deal breaker. Seriously this thing is useless unless your on a level area. Alrest is wide tall and full of nooks and crannies. If you arent up for looking behind every corner checking every hole youll miss you stop. My advice: You better listen to whoever is giving you an assignment because simply following the arrow at the top of the HUD will drive you insane. Finally the story. I wont spoil anything here but I will say that its very good so far. Probably not the deepest thing out there but certainly entertaining. Leans heavily into ideas and mannerisms found in many Japanese mangas. If you like those things you throughly enjoy yourself. To sum up Id say this game is certainly worth the price of admission. Zelda kicked off the Switch launch properly and Xenoblade is giving the huge assist to finish off Nintendos efforts in 2017. Xenoblade has kicked my tail to the point that sometimes I want to just put the controller down. But those times I successfully pull off a combo of epic proportions...it just reels me back in.

There a few problems with continuity some of the films arent great villians are mostly forgettable etc. Despite these issues though the MCU has a common thread that has made its movies must watch for many especially the average moviegoer. The DCEU though...its problems are deeper than whats on the screen. From the producers directors screenwriters...If you cant get the situation right behind the camera how can you expect to put a good film on screen? Wonder Woman is a good/great film but its measured against its stablemates which helps it to look even better. Man of Steel was decent/good. Its problem was being _too_ dark for the coming out of a new Superman film. Suicide Squad was meh/decent. Problem here is we didnt need this film yet. Finally: Batman vs Superman was bad/meh. This film had way too many issues and even the most advent DC fan can see that especially when they compare it back to Wonder Woman. Having too many hands in the kitchen has wrecked the DCEU and the attempts to right the ship with Justice League doesnt seem to be helping a lot. Is it maybe time to just scrap whats on the table for Warner Bros and just restart? At least by going back to the beginning a single head can help churn out a consistent vision with none of the problems of trying to stitch together these previous films. DC characters are too well known to be saddled with such films. Superman Batman Wonder Woman all deserve better than this.'],\n",

It still boggles my mind that OEMs still make laptops that do this. Its a usability nightmare. Laptops are still generally heavier than your basic tablet or iPad. Why combine that extra weight with the feeling of pressing keys when youre holding the device in its alternate mode? So Google seems to be looking at a way around it but still leaving the keyboard attached. Granted both Google and Microsoft have tried different approaches to this. Theyve each created devices that separate the screen from the keyboard. But this still results in some compromises. The Surface Pro requires a kickstand and has stability issues when used on your lap. And the Pixel C was top heavy to an extent. In their defense though you could at least detach the Keyboards and flip them so as to not encounter the issues of most other 2n1s.

But...I just dont know. I cant help but to think back to all the hype the new Ghostbusters received and I become a bit jaded.

Its just too bad she has to carry the weight of 3 past films that have varied between alright (MoS) to okay (Suicide Squad) to terrible (BvS).

Maybe Im just reading too much into the newest trailer but it makes me cringe. In my opinion Star Wars is nothing without force users those that use it for evil and those who stand against them. Its basically a generic space odyssey a poor mans Star Trek. Ive never watched a Star Wars film for bounty hunters galactic politics foot soldiers clad in white or anything else. Ive watched solely because of those champions of good wielding swords made of light and making use of an unknown mystic force against foes who on the surface appear to be evil. If Luke Skywalkers comment about the Jedi ending means that they are going to simply evolve than Im cool with that. But if it means that all connections to the Force are going out the window...Im done. I already had hostile feelings about The Force Awakens and its copy and paste method of apeing A New Hope. (Seriously Finn wouldve been a better Jedi character as his life experience of being a Storm Trooper was something we hadnt seen in film before. Weve already seen a lonely outcast character living on a desert planet rise to prominence ) Ending Force users would be a blow to my investment in Star Wars. But who knows...maybe Im jumping the gun.

I know youre not but in my head Im beginning to wonder whether I should write on here! I probably do have depression I acknowledge that. I think my personality might not help but I agree depression is likely. I have social anxiety I over think far too much I have mild symptoms of OCD I have some body issues I hide my trichotillomania well being male (face) and Im somewhat of a perfectionist or idealist if I could have done it better then it was crap. Genetically speaking there doesnt seem to be any history of it in my family. Because of the way my last job blew up my parents became more aware of the situation. Thats not to say they were completely blind to it but it became more of a discussion. My parents have both had depression due to work but were fine before and after the event that caused it (tribunals etc) but they dont really understand the lack of reason side of it. I shared with them for a while on both ups and downs but got the impression it was upsetting them so have largely stopped talking about it. I never mentioned suicide to them. Again due to the situation my older sister became aware and she too pressed a little but there is a limit you want to talk about things when all it does is upset people and they cant help you anyway. I have not talked about it with other family members. Im already known as the depressing one so I try to sound super happy when Im around family now. I was told that the reason Im at least subconciously left out in family gatherings is because Im quiet/ serious/ boring (actual terms!). Im aware theyd care if I wasnt here most people are genetically programmed to protect their kin but my absence would make no difference really. I now spend Xmas away from family Im fairly sure theyre happier for it! I hate being a chore. I love your statement about it being disgusting sweet s*t thats so very much my style even in the depths its very much black humour sarcasm etc struggle with sweet stuff! Outside my family there is just my girlfriend. That sounds extreme but its really not. I dont have a single other friend that is equally my fault. But I talk to no one from University days no ex colleagues etc. I know noone else. Partially I like it that way its easy and I dont feel like a burden on the other hand I feel like some of them could have fought to look after me they all gave up very easily. I know thats not fair. You shouldnt test your friends. But on the other hand if I really cared for someone and knew they were struggling emotionally Id put in a little more effort. I wasnt ever mean or snappy with them I just kind of disappeared. But its not their job to understand mental issues they have their own busy lives with their own problems. So I sometimes speak to my girlfriend less so these days though. When it all hit the fan I had no choice but to share everything with her not that it was brand new information of anything Ive been with her for a long time. But maybe the intensity of the feelings was new of the fact they were always there. But again theres very little she can do so why depress her. I dont want to see her cry because of me. So Ive largely stopped talking about things in a way that might give her the impression Im improving. Occasionally stuff slips out or I sarcastically mention leaving but I cover it well now. I still tell her to find someone else I cover it in a light/jokey way but although Im not stupid and I know she sees though it it is kind of an acceptable level of sharing. Youre right about social anxiety too. That I fully recognise. I care way more than I should or want to about others thoughts. Doesnt stop it though. I do analyse everything Ive said and done before and after events but I cant forget it really stupid example I still remember saying something that was taken the mick out of at school probably really mildly and that was about twenty five years ago! How the hell can I get over this when I still stew over stuff I said when I was 9?! Despite seeing every flaw in myself I dont take criticism well not in a grumpy way but in a defeatest way. If Im told a million things are good but this needs improving then it was an awful experience. I know that is both ridiculous and common but want it stop effecting me so much. In complete contrast I am very patient and forgiving of others Ill always see the other side of the argument and Ill happily give people as much time as they need. Im the epitomy of do as I say not as I do!. I know where Im going wrong I know my thought processes are messed up but I just dont know how to fix them. I cant think of many situations where Ive felt better than anyone else the closest I get it wondering why horrible people in this world are more likely to succeed stupidity is rewarded (TOWIE type) rudeness is applauded (Cowell) stabbing people in the back is relabled ambition and generous people get walked on and criminals win the lottery! Im really happy youve started to figure your life out. You sound very intelligent and in control. You also mentioned being in school so I suspect you are quite young for you to have such a good grip on your feelings and recognise triggers and mental health issues is quite impressive. Is it an avenue you have interest in? Im genuinely happy you have got such a grip on it early understanding it early may help you in the long run I dont know but I suspect the longer this is left the harder it is to undo the learning to hate yourself that is embedded in to you. Much like whe I used to teach the longer you left a mistake/misconception with a child the harder it was to unteach it so I just have 34 years to unteach myself!

I dont think its the lack of doing anything that causes this however Im still better than when I was at work/ socialising but then if this is the best it gets... well. I have visitied the Doctor and for the record he was really nice. Very supportive in fact. But it didnt change the fact I felt stupid and as if I was wasting his and others time. I remember being really worked up about the fact our appointment slot was overunning because I felt like I was holiding up other people.

If I leave her there is nowhere to go that really is it. I mean that in the practical sense here house etc but also it means that really is the end. I stay through her appeals and for maybe that ounce of hope that she and others are right that itll pass. Although Ive always been like this. Im not staying with her for ease or to string her along but leaving her really is a final decision I have no belief there is something better than her. Probably makes no sense. The 1% hope keeps me alive therefore the 1% keeps me here. If I lose the here I have absolutely zero interest in the alive. I really do appreciate your replies a constructive kick is better than a compassionate hug for me. But I cant find that kick that I cant talk my way around or explain away. I hate my head! I have actually tried everything Im supposed to maybe not for long enough but Ive seen zero difference. Leaving work calmed me down and made me able to uncurl from a ball but does that mean I can never return to a job? That then creates different problems emotionally and financially. I saw the CBT guy but nice as he was he tried a religious route with me (never going to work) and I put on my fake chatty character for the hour even if I was tired afterwards. It didnt do anything. Even if I try to get refered again by the Doctor Id actually be scared that Id be seeing him again or be seen to have asked not for him and although Im fairly sure he wouldnt care it genuinely freaks me out! How messed up is that?! Im actually ok if I prepare well for an hour or so around people I can seem easy going and chatty any longer than that and it gets difficult. If I cant prepare i.e. I know there will be questions Im not expecting or its someone I feel who will judge me e.g. a car mechanic as a guy then I cant do it. How silly is this I still get uneasy surrounded by teenage girls! Im not in the remotest bit interested in them obviously but just the feeling of inadequacy/ that Im a loser makes me feel weird. Same with family there is a duration before it gets too personal I can feel myself being overly happy and lively around them as if its all pouring out on first meeting them but that there is a finite amount and then my energy drops and I disappear.
