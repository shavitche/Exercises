dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I'm not even sure I have depression, I think this may just be 'me'.

I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal
upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and
even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally
feel like I'm not really worth anything and, inevitably enventually, will
become a burden.

I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so
pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or
even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness.
Selfish I know.

I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get
physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on
negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same,
play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away.
Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I
can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be
ultimately better off.

So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always
something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like
constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own
thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I
had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so
disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my
sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on
medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In
fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped
taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four
session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk,
I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and
putting on that face/ jokey responses.

I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be
backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to
refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories'
are proved.

I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better',
largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring
and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has
done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.

A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason; PTS, loss,
finances etc - does anyone have no 'good' reason?

I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on
those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all
if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life
would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't
effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.

Not sure if there is an answer for this, just writing. I'm not angry, I'm
not hurt, I'm not even sad as such, I'm just tired...
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"What a fantastic answer, but also a really bad one!! Let me explain...

=E2=80=8BFirstly I'm very pleased to see you are happy and treat every day =
as a
gift. Obviously I'm sorry you have such daily physical problems but I'm
sure that makes you even happier you did the skydiving when you did. I'm
really pleased what you did worked for you and it's encouraging to find a
rare example of someone who has somewhat defeated depression even if the
cost of that has been quite extreme.

=E2=80=8BBut then on the same hand, not recognising how lucky I am isn't th=
e
problem, it's knowing that I am and I'm still not feeling good which then
further compounds how bad I feel about myself. I know I'm luckier than
most, I know things could be worse, I live in an affluent country with
water on tap, have good health and had a normal upbringing with no major
traumas. So knowing this makes me feel EVEN worse about myself. I see
I'm selfish, and ungrateful, and petty and all other words - why can't I
just be happy?

=E2=80=8BI've put my life on the line a few times, both within the safety c=
onfines
of organised activities and on the less controlled activities I may do
myself - it doesn't help me. Being near death doesn't impact me positively
or negatively - I'm almost apathetic to it.

=E2=80=8BAnd this is why your answer is both fantastic and bad! For you, an=
d others
it may work. You are obviously an inspiration to lots of people not only
for the physical issues (which are almost a separate issue) but for the
fact you have altered your way of thinking in a positive manner. But they
also highlight how everyone's issues are unique - and as well intentioned,
and even correct, your view that it could be worse it, that can actually
make people feel worse.

=E2=80=8BIf we all focused on 'it could be worse' they'd be very few people=
 in this
world who could complain, unfortunately it's not that simple. This
depression doesn't care that I'm lucky, it just cares that I think badly of
myelf and reminds me of it every day and actually accelerates when I speak
to people who could argue they do have a good reason to feel bad. I know I
don't - and that makes it even worse.

=E2=80=8BThanks for your reply, I hope I didn't come across aggressively! I=
'm very
happy that you are happy and hope things improve if that's possible for
you. Good luck, have a great Christmas and a lovely New Year.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I had a few people on her write to me over Xmas/ New Year but needed to
ignore them - too much energy was needed to focus on acting happy and
normal around family!

=E2=80=8BI wish I could talk to you more directly than on an open forum. I'=
ve said
before, knowledge is a great thing - but it can also be a curse. You need
to be particuarly careful self-diagnosing but also need to think whether
this diagnosis is in any way helpful to you. Say you decide that you are
HFAS - how does that help you? If you can't source help then it is just
another meaningless semantic for feeling awful day to day.

=E2=80=8BI've also mentioned that it is probably important to get outside y=
our own
head - think about doing things that stop you thinking about yourself.
However, as a caveat, I also recognise doing anything (like talking to
another human being as you rightly point out!) can be extrememly stressful.

=E2=80=8BI'd never pick holes in others punctuation and grammar unless they=
 were
doing it to others! It's a forum, not a thesis! However if you have the
time and pride to check your message back then maybe you do have the time
to look at HFAS if it interests you.

=E2=80=8BTo be honest, knowledge is something I despise yet am addicted to =
so I
will inevitably be searching HFSA after I've written this reply! But
without an argument or focus it is impossible to really research a topic to
any purpose. I will happily help others if I can (preferably from afar!)
but not sure what I could do to focus your research on this matter and
whether it'd even be of any benefit to you anyway.

=E2=80=8BLike I said, there is certainly an interesting discussion to be ha=
d but
unfortunately I doubt this is the place to do it effectively for you or I.

=E2=80=8BGood Luck.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Quick research, scan read. Told you I would... I definitely don't have
HFSA. You may well have but it'd take more than a quick chat to establish
that.

=E2=80=8BAs I'm sure you're aware, everyone is somewhere on the autistic sp=
ectrum
and all the various labels that spin off that. Even the most 'normal' of
people might feel particuarly calmed by a colour, or get irritated by a
simple tapping noise. The issues arise when your 'quirks' impact on your
life. Mine do for me, and yours sound like they do for you.

=E2=80=8BI have had a ton of labels I have both researched or been told abo=
ut that
might fit my ways of thinking and acting but the conclusion I reached was
that it was all kind of pointless - a label by its very nature is just a
broad title to fit many people and when that comes to the brain it's a very
pointless exercise. You might be able to group broken limbs in patients but
with the head it's nearly impossible  - there's too many bits that do or
don't apply for every individual. Ultimately a title is only helpful to
point you in the right direction to get you personalised help. And it HAS
to be personalised.

=E2=80=8BI think I have depression, with social anxiety. I have signs of bi=
polar, I
get symptoms of SAD, I have trichotillomania, I have mild OCD that gets
worse if I'm stressed, I have panic attacks, I over think everything, I
have low self-esteem and no confidence, I feel suicidal most days and a
million other mini-labels. Doesn't help me though. It's the classic 'what's
in a name?'

=E2=80=8BI hope you see my point. We sound very similar yet I would class m=
yself as
a people pleaser, I rarely sure emotion outside the house and am overly
polite to even strangers. So whilst HFSA might apply in parts, it doesn't
solve everything.

=E2=80=8BThink about what you want from this title. How will it help you? Y=
ou might
be better focusing on the things that make you feel better, not labelling
something that makes you feel bad.

Good luck.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I doubt you have no one, family is only one part. Work friends? Neighbours?

But, for the sake of discussion, if there is really no-one then in a way
you know how to feel better and that gives you a lot of power. I don't even
know how to be 'happy' and feel I should leave those around me before I
drag them down too!

If you feel lonely, then be a little more proactive, join some clubs or
groups etc. Without being offensive, you are a little older than me and
there are a lot more clubs set up for your age group than mine that
wouldn't be intimidating. I get expectations of sports clubs (loud bravado
people!) or nightclubs etc where as I'm sure there are more suitable groups
for you. Knowing what you want to make you happy is a great thing.

As for your family, you seem to want nothing to do with them. Great! Sorry,
people on here may say that's sad etc or to try but it's your situation -
if you simply don't get on then absolutely forget them. People survive
without families all the time. Or you mentioned the recluse, maybe you need
each other...

I sympathise, in case that didn't come across, so whilst I appreciate I
have one on you by having a partner (although that can make you feel worse
by the way in that you feel like a burden) you also have one on me knowing
what will make you happy.

You don't need family/partner to feel loved. In fact family's love often
feels more 'because you're family' than out of want. Friends are there
purely because they want to be.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Hi Hypercat, I really didn't mean any offence, I just meant you have more
access to such activities due to your age. I bet most of the people in
those activities you talk of are of similar age and are in similar
situations due to unemployment, retirement etc. You may well be the
youngest there but I'm sure you have plenty in common with them. In fact
I'm envious! All I was trying to say is there isn't that social world more
mid 30 year olds, you're kind of expected to be all sociable and loud. My
one friend tried to get me to go to a craft course - he's ten years older
than me, and he was youngest be 10 years! It doesn't mean its not pleasant
to some degree but you do feel very 'odd one out'

I apologise if I jumped to conclusions based on your message but I maintain
that with the active social life you live you have LOADS of people who
would miss you. Love is not exclusively available from family and partners.
You seemed to suggest this was why you were largely unhappy so I think you
know what makes you tick; you miss a partner/ family bonds. I'm not going
to be stupid enough to say 'fix it' then as it's never that simple, but
knowing what would make you happy is a positive; at least it gives you a
target.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Great message. Funnily enough I am/was a teacher too - but I think the
environment is particularly toxic for those with is style of thinking (the
profession is based around you/ the work never being good enough and what
can you do to improve in the UK)

Catch 22 means that once this impacts you to the degree I had to quit my
job, it means you cut off a social group and have no money for new
experiences/ days out.

As regards you, I'd stay in Australia! I imagine it's a lot nicer when you
have a crappy day opening the curtains to sunshine! Tthat'd make a little,
but significant difference.

I'm not sure what I'll do now, think teaching is gone, can't see what I can
do to keep me 'sane' as a career and find very little point in most things.
I go to CBT but it just feels like we're talking about philosophy, my way
of thinking hasn't changed one iota.

I had no reasons to think this way, I created them almost. Now I actually
have no job etc. I am not a victim, I did it to myself. I think I have just
given up, if I see 2015 I will be a little surprised as I imagine something
will come along in next few months that will be enough to knock me fully
over the edge; an unexpected bill, a worry how I'm impacting on my partner,
a death in the family - something...
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I do love travelling but now, having just had to quit work, it isn't even
possible for me to 'save' at all. Besides, my gf still has a job so I'm
taking on my full time job of being a burden [image: wink]

Everything you write makes perfect sense. But the most relevant part is the
tone; you seem to know everything isn't perfect but know your triggers and
that there is good and bad. I was joking about staying in Oz, I fully
recognise complications regarding family etc. Fortunately, or
unfortunately, I now have no friends, no job, limited family (that I see
rarely anyway) so am not tied to any geographical place. It's just gfs job
that keeps me where I am.

I just struggle with people so much that I need a job that has little
interaction. Don't get me wrong, most people would see me as easy going,
relaxed, even funny at work but it is all such a tiring act I can never
maintain it. I just spend my time thinking they don't really like me, or
they think I'm an idiot or that I'm crap at my job. Think I just need to be
a recluse!
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"We certainly have strong similarities, you seem to be a lot further along
in your understanding of you and your triggers though. Going to Australia
in the first place is quite an acheivement and you must be doing something
right!

I too only really get enjoyment from helping others, the issue comes that
when that 'problem' is solved I feel of no use and begin to withdraw. I
have done it with friends and family. My girlfriend is a case in point, she
had relationship, financial and work issues and I helped her solve all of
these to be in a better place to the point now she considers everything to
be pretty good in those departments, but I have nothing left to offer her.
Worse still, I am now only going to be a burdn on her financially and
emotionally and can offer her no decent future prospects. All that swims in
my head is ""if you love them let them go"" as staying with her seems very
selfish.

However, she is the first person who I have ever really shared this with.
My past relationships completed the cycle! She understands as much as one
can and is very supportive but I feel that her patience must run out
eventually (she's a teacher so she does have a lot!) and she shouldn't have
to deal with this anyway.

If I were you I'd visit America. Not sure where you're going but if you
have the means then do it. If nothing else it is something to look back on
one day and think 'wow, I did that' and gives you that ton more of info to
talk about with friends, strangers, future partners that can fill those
awkward moments when you're not sure what to say! You've lived abroad,
nearly everyone would say that's pretty cool!

Cheers for the offer of a drink ha ha! But I'm so crap I'd probably just
put it off and hope to be left alone! The lovely thing about the internet
is it is so anonymous even I don't mind being honest. The second I meet
someone I'm worrying I'm boring them, annoying them etc! Even my CBT doc!

I wish I could find just one positive to focus on. I really can't. The only
one I should have (my gf) I twist to make it one of the biggest negatives -
me being a burden to her. I'm not fun, I'm not confident, I now have no
job, I have cr*p future financially, I can never acheive in basic things
like house buying etc (I've never even owned a car in my name!) because
every time I get myself on an even keel I sabotage it best I can, waiting
for the disaster to hit.

Cheers for the replies.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Thanks for the reply, its nice to know you're not alone isn't it? However,
it'd be nicer if people said it got any better! I hate the idea that this
is forever, like an alcoholic or something!

I hope you haven't given up; I don't know how you just 'get over it', for
good or bad! I have no spiritualty (I almost envy those who do!) so am
under no illusions that it gets better after life but, much like someone in
constant physical pain, I feel like I should be allowed to just give up
without guilt.

I fully empathise with your issues, they sound identical! I beat myself up
a little more as, being a man, society expects you to step up - think I get
weird looks when the gf is dealing with everything!

I wish you luck with your future too - I hope you are doing something to
try and fight it as I think without at least trying Meds/ Talk therapy etc
then giving up in your head can easily turn in to giving up 'properly'.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I have read the replies and sympathise with you all, despite it being some
time since I wrote the original post. Unfortunately little changes.

Paulsinbc you sound very similar! I'm impressed you can volunteer, I
struggle with people and then somehow feel worse as I think I should be
able to cope compared to people who have REAL problems. I've never felt
hard done by or unfortunate - my problems are me!

However, you're right, there is an element of fanning the flames! The
reason I've largely stopped looking at this site is I don't see a benefit
for me or anyone else. I recognise some may get comfort from support from
like minded people, or signposted to suitable resources or recognise
symptoms of PTS or similar, but for me all I read is people who live with
it forever with no answers and that in itself is depressing.

People say knowledge is power, but I find it to be a curse. The more you
know, the more you realise your insignificance, the hopelessness of
situations and the reality of the world rather than the rose-tinted 'it'll
all work out in the end' view we're told to believe. I really struggle with
the inability of professionals to accept that some people don't succeed,
some people do fail, some people aren't talented, some people aren't nice -
why can't that be me? It's no different than saying ""it can't happen to me"".

So for that reason I'm very much keeping this site at arms length. I'd
unrealistically hoped for advice or signposting or, ridiculously, a miracle
cure but it's more a gathering for people to support each other with
knowing nods or virtual hugs. I recognise the support that may give to
others but for me, it just makes me feel worse.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"What is it with my compulsion to reply despite my last comment?! [image:
wink]

Yeah 8 months, feels both more and less. Unfortunately I doubt I will
either give you insightful answers or even a nice positive slant on my
response - you have been warned!

Little has changed. I tried drugs, didn't work, I tried therapy, too much
religion and not willing to try again - a weird catch 22 in where you need
to ask for help but are afraid of talking to people even day to day.
Friends are nonexistent, I quit my job and haven't returned. I still feel
like a burden to those around me, and how ever much they care it doesn't
excuse it - in fact it makes it worse. I can't escape feeling that if I was
a good person then I'd protect them from me - if you were highly infectious
with a  deadly disease would you hug your family? So internally and
externally, very much status quo. I'm still here, slightly surprisingly.

It is fair to say I'm confused as to my wants and beliefs about my
situation. One day it's just me and there is no hope, next day it's won't
please someone give me a magic wand (but I won't ask!). If I seem
ungrateful with any responses then that wasn't my intention, maybe it's my
way, I always focus on negative and all I see is lots of people struggling
and no-one coming out the other side. It feels like the blind leading the
blind.

Further more most people seem to have a good reason through circumstance or
substance abuse or dramas in their life -I'm just like this for no real
reason. Pretty pathetic really.

My girlfriend does support me but it both helps me survive and yet stops me
facing my issues and makes me feel not good enough and as if I'm holding
her back. I know she doesn't feel that, but I feel like it MUST or it will
eventually when she realises what she'll miss out on.

Cycles of mood are continuous but rarely hit a positive slant, some days
I'm just ok and potter around and others I feel the strongest urge to give
up. The only trigger I know doesn't help (but isn't crucial) is the weather
but that's common with lots of people. A bad day will turn in to a bed day
easily if it's grey! Lucky I live in UK [image: wink]

I've tried improvements in diet etc but I'm not exactly a bad eater anyway,
exercise is fine but doesn't really change anything, just gives me
something to do. Easily lose will to do it though. My socialising is
obviously nonexistent and I try to encourage girlfriend to do her own thing
with friends in that respect.

So in summary, nothings changed, I'm in a state of status quo, every plan I
come up with I find a major flaw in, I strongly doubt there's a way out, I
hate the way I look, sound and feel and feel I should protect people from
their own blinkered love.

So, sorry and hope you have more success.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I'm not deluded enough to think people wouldn't care if someone close to
them wasn't there anymore. People aren't generally that heartless. However,
it doesn't mean they wouldn't be better off. Like a child who is removed
from an unfit parent; they'd cry and be upset and miss them but ultimately
they're better off. We all get over loss - we don't as easily get over
regret, disappointment and missed opportunities. Only I hold people back.

I agree, I have nothing to really complain about, I almost wish I did as
then it'd explain it. I just can't cope with society; I can't even talk to
people on the phone or worry about what a stranger thinks of me. I just
don't know what to do; stubbornness, stupidity, anxiety stops me from doing
things and every time I try to fight it I can only keep up the pretence for
a while and then everything collapses. I just know I'm right - we seem
scared to admit some people are just failures and not equipped. We could
name loads of people in our lives we could say are useless or horrible etc,
but the second their is an element of affection for them is we decide to
lie to them and ourselves - ""they're just unlucky/ need help/ have hidden
talents"" - I don't believe it.

I have, and if not struggling, do still do a fair bit of exercise. Cycling,
jogging etc but fitness has never really helped. In my 20s particularly I
was extremely fit but it didn't help. When I said way I look I meant more
appearance than shape.

I do appreciate responses but worry there is no hope. Maybe I can't hear it
even if there is....
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I smiled at that last comment - my girlfriend says I'm too nice. It's a
idea I struggle with (how can someone be too nice?) but she says people
just take advantage or walk all over me. I'd bend over backwards to help a
stranger even if it detrimented me which is possibly part and parcel of the
worrying about what others think element. So whilst on here I may come
across ungrateful I can assure you I'm not really - this is perhaps my
selfish place. I've tried to be very thankful for all the responses on
here, I just struggle to see any benefit in it.

You can't say you have a hidden talent and then not say what it is [image:
wink] that's just mean...! Good for you though. Genuinely. However some
people are just bang on average, I'm one of those. I'm not in some deluded
spiral that makes me think I'm the worst at anything, or have a difficult
hand or anything, I'm just realistic and know I, like many others, are just
bang on average but if I do dip one way it's always the worse than average
way. It's my head that beats me up for my limitations and stops me just
fuctioning - it's hard to explain so I'll stop!

Trying to think of good things is difficult for me, I can't think of
anything I can't put a negative slant on! Maybe I'm good at arguing... But
if I look at widely accepted sections of my life it's not a good overall
picture:

Family - fed up with me, disappointed and feel sorry for me on one hand.
Have never really included me anyway (but maybe that's my withdrawal
tendancies)

Love Life - good and yet that makes it bad! If I didn't care about her I'd
be quite happy taking advantage but if you love someone you don't want to
hurt them in any way, emotionally, financially, future etc. If you love
them let them go as the saying goes...

Financially - was poor, sorted with job, would be cleared up in a few years
(credit) but don't struggle day to day at all as girlfriend is very
successful. So I'm just leaching...

Friends - if you can measure a person by their friends then I'm zero. I
mean zero, not one person. My fault, there fault it, it doesn't really
matter.

Health - other than this(!) ok really, standard weight, normal height,
don't smoke, drink or do drugs. Eat reasonably healthily and do sport
sporadically when it's either sunny and/or I have a spark of inspiration.
Tried routines, lasted a week before a bad day threw it all off.

Career - down the pooper! Can't return to full time teaching, know I can't
do that. To 'stuck up' for want of a better word to take a shop job knowing
I trained to be a teacher. Also can't find another job that is term time
only (to spend time with partner). I'd struggle in ANY job anyway. Too
overqualified for most things that might suit purpose. Supply is
possibility but that means new people and stuff every day - not my string
point! Plus it means phone calls for availability and I can't talk on
phone! Pathetic, whinging, excuse riddled crap eh? Not on benefits or
anything as gf is on plentiful wage.

Looks - awful, have the face of a teenager who can't grow even a hint of a
moustache never mind a beard which means I'm constantly asked for ID (or my
parents if a knock at the door) despite being 34!!! People say you should
be flattered but to me it feels like a kick in the face - maybe it's the
bloke thing, it's like people telling you you're a child. I almost am a
child... My facial skin is awful too, no creams or regimes suggested by the
girlfriend work so I've just given up. Maybe I'm an expert at giving up!!
To be fair, all things above have been tried for at least 6 months from
drugs to therapy to face cream!

I do appreciate your help/advice. I still wonder if it's just character
rather than depression. Maybe I'm just a cynical, boring, lonely, ugly
loner. That's fine when it's just you, a killer when you feel you're
holding others back from a 'proper' life.

"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Let me start by saying I feel for you, I really do. You have a GENUINE
reason to feel like you do and should not feel bad or apologise for asking
for help! You make me feel even more pathetic but that's my issue rather
than yours!! Perspective makes me think even worse of myself as I know I'm
lucky compared to lots - so why do I feel like this?

As regards the drug route, a lot of people have suggested this. However one
major issue stops me and is not really ever talked about - I'm terrified of
people/meetings etc! So I can't see a Doctor! When at my lowest I was being
ferried around so had no choice and needed a Doctors note etc but now the
thought of seeing a Doctor (or any body I know I have to talk to) terrifies
me to the point I'd almost have a panic attack. So not sure what to do
there really! Still not convinced on the drug thing anyway - it only made
me slightly manic (obsessed with projects) and had no effect on my overall
mood at all, well other than making the idea of 'going' seem even more
rational.

So instead of me whinging on and on let me just make a few completely
uneducated comments regarding your situation. You don't seem depressed so
much as tired! I don't mean that in a dismissive way but you clearly have a
lot on your plate and I think (if there is any) you need some support. I'd
go as far as saying I doubt the drugs are halping you - they seem to be
treating a symptom not a cause.

Did you have anxiety before all the pressures you're under? I think you'd
feel a hell of a lot better quicker if you directed your energy to finding
financial and/or respite support if there is any. You're probably doing too
much and it's impacting on your health physically and emotionally. If there
isn't any further help then, other than shaking your head at the hand
you've been dealt, then you seem to have a good plan of action at the
moment. If that plan could be super organised to include you (as in time
for yourself etc) and maybe incorporate a job (if you so wished) you may
find you were in control a bit more.

I'm not trying to sound dismissive at all I promise! You have a compelling
reason to feel the way you do and I acknowledge I'm talking without all the
facts. I just get the sense it's a lack of control on a very hectic/
emotional draining life that is you're primary concern. For example, if you
won the lottery and could deal with all the bills and give the care to your
daughter you wish do you think you'd feel infinitely better? You're
depressed because of the situation I think so hopefully either you, or you
and others, could plan a route that would help you considerably. I think
there is a lot of hope for you to be VERY happy and enjoy your life with
your daughter but you've just been struggling for years and it's worn you
down. Asking for help (other than medicinal) is the right way to go.

"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Please don't be sorry - very aware that's my issue not yours!

You sound like you have a very clear plan, you almost sound excited! I'm
sure you are, but if you're not do, but make that your focus and you may
feel the clouds lift quite a lot! I envy that purpose, or goal or action
plan - I can't think of any!

I think my girlfriend might stay with someone she felt sorry for, like a
responsibility for so to speak. I think she WOULD be sad if I 'left' but
she'd be happy again a lot sooner than having to live with me! It's quite
analytical, I recognise that, but to me I'd rather her be sad for a year
with 'loss' rather than sad for 20 years with me! It's weighing up value,
short term pain for long term gain... As for a job, my head stops me, I
feel I can do most jobs but only temporarily as my head messes me up,
messes my professional relationships up and I just can't see how I can hold
down a job - it's hard to explain, but being sociable (like you have to be
at work) is almost physically draining and eventually my energy runs out
and I drop all the balls I'm juggling.

You may be right about reason for depression but the genetic one concerns
me most - that means I'll never be 'fixed'... I'd rather just give up now.

Ordinary to me is depressing. Ordinary is forgetable, ordinary is boring,
ordinary doesn't 'exist'. To give you a glimpse of my thinking; the popular
kids in school were 'exceptional', but even the bullied kids had something
about them. When you're average, you're invisible. You can take the
(friendly) mick out of someone who's bad at something, you can admire the
talent of someone who's great at something, but when someone is average
it's just a shrug, no story, move on. I'm genuinely the most forgettable
man in the world! I'm one of a large group of siblings, I'm one forgotten
in family dos, I was one forgotten at school (old teacher remembered all
siblings during catch up chat to parents bar me) I'm one forgotten at work
- I really am a waste of space!

The media's main fault is trying to make people believe that happy endings
exist, that we all have a hidden talent and if you want something enough
then it magically comes true. Sorry, my view is very much it doesn't! It
doesn't 'all work out in the end' and we're just fed this fantasy world
that depresses us when the reality slaps us in the face!

Sorry - trying so hard not to just 'release' on here....

"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Please do not get me wrong, I do not believe any one characteristic makes
someone of no value, further more I think it'd be impossible not to be of
SOME value, it's just to what weighting you give a value when compared to
all the problems it may cause. For example, alcohol gives you a small boost
but, when abused, can cause significant problems. For those with a problem,
it may be better to just give up the alcohol.

I too have multiple issues with religion (that's a real rant!) but I don't
think anyone has the right to judge another. I would never judge anyone
else as worthless, but I know myself and can judge myself. I stand by that
judgement based on what I know, what I do, what I think and the proof I
have. A person suffering from anorexia will ignore the scales reading too
low a weight, I suffer from no dilusions. Everything points to me being
everything I think I am.

You sound like a much better person than me, you maintain strength in
difficulty and have the fight in you to counter injustice. I can barely
face people so volunteering is out of the question, whether that is lazy or
cowardly, I simply can't pretend to be 'normal' any more and public is so
much energy.

I am a faceless person on here. The reality of me is much worse.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I care a lot about most people, more than is healthy perhaps. I take on
others problems if I can and feel more useful if I'm helping someone else.
I'm often accused of making people's decisions for them regarding me
though, although I don't see that as an issue if I'm protecting them. For
example I say I should leave gf to protect her, she and family say it's her
decision to give up on me not mine. I still struggle a lot with that way of
thinking. I feel you should protect people, even from themselves sometimes.

A reply after 8 months due to some shift.... bit more mundane I'm afraid,
someone replied after a long time, put effort in to their thread and I had
an email telling me so I felt it was polite to respond! Sorry!

Is 'holding back' a strange metaphor?! :D But yeah, maybe that's what it is
- in fact it'd be easier to escape as I have no upper body strength at all!
But it's meant more in the way that if I struggle through on the low level
I am my girlfriend will put up with it and not have the marrigate, house,
holidays, and have to basically look after me (phone calls, sorting
anything that invloves others, avoiding social events to look after me)
where as if I went, she'd be sad for a while, perhaps never even forget,
but move on and get a 'proper' boyfriend and get all that stuff. She didn't
sign up for this - she met the fake easy-going confident full time teacher
with prospects...!

Is there such thing as too much time on a computer?! I didn't realise! I
filled in a survey the other day - it said how long do you spend on the
interent a day. I was strugling to find the 'all day' option!
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"It's strange talking on the internet as you answer one comment but then
someone else adds an extension question, but all of it is stuff you've
thought before. Does that make sense?! Another words, whilst I offer my
opinion on a particular though process it doesn't mean I've not actually
gone far beyond that in my own thinking.

So to answer your very well thoughout view, it is all stuff I have thought
of before and almost counted out! I'm just a whiner obviously [image: wink]

If I did what I want I'd be sportsman, but then we have to be realistic and
say that isn't going to bring in any wage! Besides, I also know I struggle
in team situations in reality as I struggle with the bravado that is
especially prevalent in male sports. So what else do I enjoy, genuinely,
nothing. But even I recognise that might be an extension of my apathy.
Teaching is fun, I love working with kids... but the other teachers,
parents, Ofsted, paperwork, and most constant judgement of any career makes
it impossible. On a side note, if you have any issues with self confidence,
teaching is NOT the way to go! I've never known a career in which you're so
reguarly scutinised and there's always something you could have done better
- and if you're of a fragile nature you naturally only focus on that.

No jobs don't have to be people based, I too have worked in media as a
journalist (although that is people based!) but can't think of anything I'd
enjoy or, more pertinently, be able to do - skill, time or wage wise!
Setting up a cattery would be nice, but need money for that. Being an
architect always appealed by I have neither the time (course duration) or
the skills to do it!

I'm not sure if this is normal or not; I struggle with people but also
struggle alone. It's not like once I have escaped people I feel relaxed.
Maybe I'm in a sydrome called 'grass is always greener'! When left alone I
am even more self destructive in my thoughts - thinking time is not good
time.

I do appreciate you saying 'maybe there isn't anything you massively excel
in' - it's those kind of statements that make me think people are writing
realistically rather than using a softly softly approach. It's not like
negatives are the only reality but I can only begin to believe a statement
if people acknowledge the bad. People saying ""I'm sure you're good at x""
just makes me turn off, someone saying ""Ok, you're crap at that BUT
try...."" is much more realistic. Unfortunately I haven't found the good
thing!

I know that 'you'd be better off' is an extremely frustrating statement.
The question is, do you reveal what you're thinking or keep it to yourself?
I always say 'be careful what you ask or you might not like the answer',
but if I'm being asked to open up and not bottle feelings then where is the
line on what is acceptable to share and what isn't? I can't help very
strongly feeling that.

I do think time heals and it seems logical to reduce any pain to it's
minimum; a year or so after I'm gone or a lifetime of regrets, missed
opportunities and struggles with me around. I can't do the whole marriage,
kids thing. I am next to useless when it comes to mortgages and luxuries.
We all start with dreams of being rich and famous and having everything we
want, we then give up certain dreams as childhood subsides and reality
kicks in, as we get older we give up more and more dreams as we can't
achieve them. But once you've given up every dream, don't you just fade
away? A very old person knows they will not travel the world again, they
know they can not look like a 30 year old movie star, their wish may be to
see a grandchild go to university or even simply to reach 100. But once
you've done everything you can do, or know you will ever do, then, to me,
it feels like it's time to go.

I tried the meds, ok only once, but it didn't work. I can't face going back
to the doctors again and having to talk about all this. It feel so pathetic
talking to a grown man about my piddly stupid head. There's people going in
there with proper problems, or at least fixable ones!

Am I afraid of death? Not really, the thought of it is very much in my
head. And I mean the actual thought, not the before or the after, the
thought of that last breath then nothing. I don't think greatly of the
drama of after a death (like 'oh people will miss me etc etc) I just am
transfixed on the thought of that very last spark of the brain. It will
come one day. Whilst I'm very careful not to talk about suicide on here
('gone' or 'left' being much friendlier terms) I know I'd never make me
passing traumatic for train divers, dog walkers or unsuspecting family
members.

Bungee-jumping, skydiving or Vegas all sound great. But that's where the
reality sets in, how exactly am I paying for this?! If there was one thing
that I think would have the greatest impact on my mental health it'd be
winning the lottery - I could then distract myself with things, or feel
like I was providing for my family. I'd still have those demons, I'd still
avoid people, I'd still have no friends etc, but instead of stewing I'd be
being kept busy on a beach in Hawaii! Money doesn't solve everything, but
it makes the low points easier to deal with as you can more readily escape.
I do love travel that being said, and when ever I can afford it I do.

I'm never going to feel differently to the way I do... that's as far as I'm
willing to agree with your last statement! [image: wink] I've actually
tried the big changes, I've tried doing the things that scare me or out of
my comfort zone. I went to University alone, along way away from family, I
travelled Europe camping for a summer, I took on jobs I didn't think I
could do, I moved to new areas with no contacts. I think I've done
everything I'm 'supposed' to improve myself and my thinking. But none of it
worked, all of is (possibly self-inflicted) failed, I always reverted to
'type'.

I appreciate everyone on here giving their time to convince me otherwise. I
have never doubted there are very nice people in this world, just as there
are horrible ones. I do believe the horrible ones get a 'better' life but
that's a different conversation. But I'm beginning to find that me
answering these views is just making me more sure I'm right - I'm a
hopeless case.

Whether it's depression, anxiety, personality, whining, my fault, other's
fault, luck or time it now kind of strikes me as irrelevant. I'm at this
destination, there are no more stops.
"
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Kick away!

Fair enough, I don't do much at the moment. I occasionally do a little bit
of exercising (jogging/cycling) but a grey cloud, real or metaphorical,
quickly kills any energy I have! I don't think it's the lack of doing
anything that causes this however, I'm still 'better' than when I was at
work/ socialising - but then if this is the best it gets... well.

I have visitied the Doctor, and for the record he was really nice. Very
supportive in fact. But it didn't change the fact I felt stupid and as if I
was wasting his, and others, time. I remember being really worked up about
the fact our appointment slot was overunning because I felt like I was
holiding up other people. But I did that because my girlfriend was with me
at all times (and forced me!) and because I needed to get a Doctors note
for work. Now I no longer work, I no longer need to waste people's time.
But you're right, I'm an expert in giving up!

The girlfriend question comment is a difficult one and the one I battle
every day more than anything else. If I leave her there is nowhere to go,
that really is it. I mean that in the practical sense here, house etc but
also it means that really is the end. I stay through her appeals and for
maybe that ounce of hope that she, and others, are right that it'll pass.
Although I've always been like this. I'm not staying with her for ease, or
to string her along, but leaving her really is a final decision - I have no
belief there is something better than her. Probably makes no sense. The 1%
hope keeps me alive, therefore the 1% keeps me here. If I lose the here, I
have absolutely zero interest in the alive.

I really do appreciate your replies, a constructive kick is better than a
compassionate hug for me. But I can't find that kick that I can't talk my
way around or explain away. I hate my head! I have actually tried
everything I'm supposed to, maybe not for long enough, but I've seen zero
difference. Leaving work calmed me down and made me able to uncurl from a
ball but does that mean I can never return to a job? That then creates
different problems emotionally and financially.

I saw the CBT guy but, nice as he was, he tried a religious route with me
(never going to work) and I put on my fake chatty character for the hour,
even if I was tired afterwards. It didn't do anything. Even if I try to get
refered again by the Doctor, I'd actually be scared that I'd be seeing him
again, or be seen to have asked not for him - and although I'm fairly sure
he wouldn't care, it genuinely freaks me out! How messed up is that?!

I'm actually ok, if I prepare well, for an hour or so around people - I can
seem easy going and chatty, any longer than that and it gets difficult. If
I can't prepare, i.e. I know there will be questions I'm not expecting or
it's someone I feel who will judge me e.g. a car mechanic as a 'guy' then I
can't do it. How silly is this - I still get uneasy surrounded by teenage
girls! I'm not in the remotest bit interested in them obviously, but just
the feeling of inadequacy/ that I'm a loser makes me feel 'weird'. Same
with family, there is a duration before it gets too personal; I can feel
myself being overly happy and lively around them as if it's all pouring out
on first meeting them but that there is a finite amount and then my energy
drops and I disappear.

Grrr.... I'm whining again. Shoot me.

itaicohen266@gmail.com,"No =E2=80=93 the intent of this guide isn't a how-to or strategy guide. My =

is to build an index of all the great information that available on pet
battling that is currently scattered across sites and posts and condense it
to one location. I'm hoping to keep this fairly up-to-date as best I can.

itaicohen266@gmail.com,"Pet battles are one of the features Blizzard introduced with the Mists of
Pandaria expansion for WoW. Currently, they're mini-games within the game,
intended as an alternative action or for when there's down-time in the
game. As there are really no rewards outside of pet-battle rewards (more
pets, achievements, titles, pet battle supplies), they are not an
alternative to gearing up your character.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"You need to have a character that is level 5 and have 10 gold. You also
need to have a full account - pet battles will not work on starter/free to
play accounts. If you meet the requirements, head to a Pet Battle trainer
to learn. (link to locations: http://www.wowpedia.org/Battle_Pet_Trainer)

Once you've learned the skill, a couple of things will happen. You'll get a
series of basic quests from the trainer which will teach you the basics of
pet battling and you'll notice little green paws on your mini-map. Those
paws represent pets you can battle with. You can select to track pet
battles with the same mini-map button you use to track everything in game.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"Ten gold is too much for new characters!
It's supposed to be. Blizzard added the pet battle system as a mini-game
for experienced players. New players should be focused on learning to play
the game. However, with the recent hotfix reducing training from 100g to
10g, this should be available much sooner for new players.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"Right now, the total pet cap is 1000. However, if you came into MoP with
more than the cap, your extra pets are still there =E2=80=93 you just can't=
 catch
additional pets. Once you dip below the cap, you can catch new pets.
In Legion, completing a series of World Quests will reward players with an
item, the Pocket Pet Portal (
http://www.wowhead.com/item=3D139003/pocket-pet-portal), that raises their
pet cap to 1500. The Pocket Pet Portal is rewarded from completing the
""Battle on the Broken Isles"" achievement, which requires completing 30
World Pet Battle quests.
In addition, you can only have up to 3 of each unique type of pet. Again,
if you came into MoP with more than 3, those pets are still there. Until
you release/cage the extras, you are unable to add more of those unique
type of pets. For example, I started MoP with 9 Cornish Rex cats. Until I
caged my extras, I was unable to learn/add additional ones.
However, some pets are unique no matter how many you had across your alts.
Pretty much any Bind to Account pet (such as the Wind Rider Cub or the 4th
anniversary Baby Blizzard Bear) and achievement pets (such as Nuts) will
only exist as a single copy in your pet journal.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"You may already have a pet collection and have all you need to get started.
However, if you're brand new and are starting with nothing, you have
several options. The Pet Trainer who taught you how to battle will also
sell you a pet based on your starting race. You can visit any of the pet
vendors in game to purchase additional pets (opposite faction pets will
either require you to visit the AH or roll an alt to purchase). Some pets
are awarded from quests, some pets are drops, some pets are awarded from
achievements, some pets are obtained from special events, some are for sale
in the Blizzard store, and some are obtained from the trading card game.
A lot of battle pets are obtained via battling and capturing wild pets
(this is covered further on in the FAQs).

Many battle pets are able to be sold on the AH. However, any pets that are
captured in the wild are NOT able to be caged/sold. Currently, Blizzard has
disabled the selling of captured pets (this is discussed further on in the
FAQs). IMPORTANT: If you buy a pre-leveled pet off the AH, you won't be
able to add it to your collection unless you already have a pet of that
level!

Warcraftpets is the definitive site for where to obtain pets. (link:
http://www.warcraftpets.com/) WoWPedia has a fantastic listing of all the
pets in game as well. (link: http://www.wowpedia.org/List_of_companions)

It is important to note that not all pets are able to do battle. The
balloon pets (Alliance, Horde, Darkmoon Faire), most kite pets (Dragon kite
with 5.1 is now able to fight), the Guild Page and Herald, and the Argent
Squire/Gruntling are ineligible for pet battles. These guys are just for
looking pretty while following you around.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"What do you mean, =E2=80=9Ccaging=E2=80=9D pets?
Currently, some pets are able to be put into a cage. Wild battle pets are
currently unable to be caged. In addition, BoA pets (such as the Blizzard
store pets), pets from achievements (such as Nuts), pets that grant
achievements (such as the Spirit of Competition), and pets from some quests
(such as the Singing Sunflower and Northrend Children=E2=80=99s Week orphan=
s) are
also unable to be caged. Vendor pets (such as the Cornish Rex cat), dropped
pets (such as the Emerald Whelpling), and some quest pets (such as the
Azeroth and Outland Children=E2=80=99s Week rewards) are able to be caged.

The best way to be tell for sure if your pet can be caged is to right-click
on it in the Pet Journal. If it can be caged, you=E2=80=99ll see that as an=
 option.
Once a pet is caged, it becomes an item in your inventory that you can
trade or sell as normal.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"What if I want to get rid of a pet that can=E2=80=99t be caged?
Your only option is to =E2=80=9Crelease=E2=80=9D the pets. This is also ava=
ilable by
right-clicking on a pet in your Pet Journal. There is no animation of the
pet running free =E2=80=93 they merely disappear from your listed pets. Tho=
se more
tender-hearted may find it hard to release some pets (Northrend orphans
have nowhere else to go!)

When I right-click, I also get the option to rename. What is that?
After years of asking, pet collectors have finally gotten the right to
rename their pets. It does exactly what you think it does =E2=80=93 you can=
 rename
your Cornish Rex to Fluffy if you so desire. Pet naming follows pretty much
the same set of rules as naming your character: nothing obscene/offensive,
no titles (such as Mr), and no linkers (such as The). You can put multiple
capital letters and spaces into a pet name, so you=E2=80=99ve got that goin=
g for
you, which is nice.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"What does the color around the pet's portrait mean?
Like gear, battle pets have a quality associated with them. Currently,
there's poor (grey), common (white), uncommon (green), and rare (blue)
pets. There are no epic or legendary pets available to PLAYERS, but some
NPC Tamers use Epic pets and the Grand Master Tamers have Legendary pets.
In addition, there are legendary pets to battle through-out Pandaria and
Draenor.
Pet quality affects the total stat values a battle pet has. Poor quality
pets will have lower stats than common quality pets of the same level, and
so on. For fighting, it's recommended to use high quality pets over lower
quality pets.
Shalura from Anvilmar has made a fantastic compilation of pre-existing pet
qualities as well. (link: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6712862299
)

There's a gold ring around my pets'/opponent pets' portrait. What does that
mean?
 The gold color indicates which pet gets to go first.

What does my pet's family mean?
If you're familiar with Pokemon (or Rock-Paper-Scissors), you'll understand
about pet types/families. WoW pet battles have a type associated with them
(for example, critter). This determines what other attack types they are
strong against (critters are strong against undead type attacks) and weak
against (critters are weak against beast type attacks), in addition to
having a special ability associated with the type (critter types break out
of crowd control more quickly). While a battle pet will have a base type,
they can also have other type's moves (for example, a rabbit, which is a
critter type, learns burrow, a beast move, at level 4).
Wowpedia has a very nice chart showing what battle pet types are strong and
weak against. (link: http://www.wowpedia.org/File:BattlePets.png?c=1)
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"What types of pet battles are there?
Like much of the game, Pet Battles have a PvE and a PvP component.

PvE battles are those battles with wild pets or with the NPC Pet Tamers.
This is the way if you want to collect pets and level them up.
(WoWPedia link: http://www.wowpedia.org/Pet_Tamer)
(WoWHead link: http://www.wowhead.com/search?q=pet+tamer)

PvP battles are battles with other players. On your Pet Battle tab, there's
a button to find a random pet battle. Unlike PvP'ing in other parts of the
game, you will not know who you are battling against. Character names are
not displayed. Also, losses are not tracked, only wins. Your pet will gain
XP from doing random PvP battles. However, dueling will not yield XP.

Tgwaste from Korialstrasz wrote a macro for finding PvP Pet Battles without
opening your pet journal (find it in the macros section of this thread).
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"Where should I go to find pet battles?
Pretty much anywhere in the world. If you're just starting out, you'll want
to level your pets along a similar zone path as a character. Lower level
battle pets are found in lower level zones and progress slightly slower
than character levels. For example, Elwyn Forest and Stormwind have level
1-2 pets while Westfall has level 2-4 pets. You'll want to start in a zone
that has pets appropriate to your pets' levels.

Quintessence (Senior Content Manager at Warcraftpets.com) has compiled a
listing of pet levels by zone. Useful for plotting out your pet-leveling
plan. (link:
http://wowpetaddiction.blogspot.com/2012/09/zones-by-pet-level.html#more)

Wrelch from Wyrmrest Accord also put together a nice forum thread with this
information: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6758257090

Warcraftpets put together a visual map with several search functions as
well http://www.warcraftpets.com/guides/pets/wow-pets-by-zone/?wild=3DY

Why are all of the pets I find Beasts and Critters in this zone? Battle
pets tend to follow the flavor of the zone. In a forested zone, you=E2=80=
=99ll find
forest pets. Near water, aquatic pets. Places with undead will have undead
pets.

Oh no! My battle pet didn't last through the battle/has been wounded. What
do I do?
You have several options to heal/revive your battle pets. One is to use
your revive pet ability, which has a 8 minute cooldown. You can visit a
stable master (able to be tracked via the mini-map) to heal/revive your
pets (no CD). Lastly, you can use a Pet Bandage (obtained from Pet Supply
bags from battling Pet Tamers, with Celestial Coins obtained from the
Celestial Tournament on the Timeless Isle, or with Pet Charms from the
Garrison Menagerie) to heal/revive your pets.

One suggestion has been to park an alt near a stable master and log onto
that character when you need to heal/revive, instead of coming in from the
wilds. However, be aware that logging into a character places a short CD (
~ 3 min) on interacting with a stablemaster (they ask for your to wait a
few minutes) and your revive pets ability.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," *How do I capture a wild pet? *
You should have a trap icon on your pet battle bar. Once a wild pet gets
below 35% health, this icon will light up and you can attempt to capture
the pet. Your chances of capture increase the lower the health of the wild
pet. This becomes a delicate dance of you trying not to kill the pet while
keeping your own pets alive. Having the Terrible Turnip or Molten Corgi as
one of your capture pets makes this a little easier, as these pets have an
ability that will never kill.

You can progress towards better traps by raising battle pets to level 25.
The Pristine Trap is the best trap in game and is earned by completing the
""Pro Pet Crew"" achievement. The Draenic Trap, which only works in Draenor,
is obtained by leveling your Garrison Pet Menagerie to level 2.

Special note: occasionally in the wild, you'll see that an additional
pet(s) has joined the battle.
If you're looking to capture more pets, pay attention to the quality of
both pets you're fighting (the additional pets' portrait will display
smaller next to the pet you're currently fighting). You can only use a trap
once per fight. Don't waste a trap on a lower-quality pet if there's a rare
pet waiting in to battle (I learned that the hard way).
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," *I've heard some pets only spawn in certain conditions. How do I know what
pets and what the conditions are?*
The Pet Journal has this information in it - if you know what pet you are
looking for (for example, the Baby Ape). At this point, the ""rare
spawn/scarce"" pets require a single condition - time of day (late night,
daytime, morning), weather (raining, sandstorm, snowing), or season
(winter, summer).

Quintessence from Warcraftpets has started a discussion thread on the
Warcraftpets forum listing some of this information.
*http://www.warcraftpets.com/community/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=368
<http://www.warcraftpets.com/community/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=368>*).

*Are there any special pets I should keep my eyes open for in each zone?*
Yes. Most zones tend to have one special, zone-unique pet. Twixi from
Garrosh put together a listing of each zone's special pet(s) and their
level, to help with your need to catch them all.
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6758627164

*Is there an advantage to raising a pet vs. catching a higher level pet? *
Not in relation to the stats. Unlike Pokemon, caught and raised pets of the
same unique type, quality, and breed (for example, two uncommon squirrels
of breed 5) will have their stats raised in the exact same manner. The only
thing affected would be the ""Raise X Pets to Level Y"" achievements, if the
pet caught is higher level than the achievement (catching a level 11 pet
doesn't count for raising pets to level 10).

More discussion of the Breeds can be found in the Theorycrafting section.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," *How does pet XP work? What about my pets in a party? *
Pets gain XP by fighting other pets (either in PvE battles vs. wild/tamer
pets or in PvP battles against other PC's pets). XP is needed to advance
your pet's levels, much like your characters need XP to level. Pets do not
gain a rested XP bonus.

Level 25 pets, and pets that are 5+ levels above the enemy pet, receive no
experience for that battle, although they do count when experience is split
(as long as they are alive at the end of the battle). A ""difficulty bonus""
is given to pets that survive a battle under certain conditions. First, if
a pet is 2+ levels below the level of the enemy pet, they generally receive
the difficulty bonus. Also, if a pet at or below the level of the enemy
pets manages to solo a multi-pet team, or 2 pets of equal or lower level
take on a 3-pet team, they will receive a difficulty bonus.

As of a hotfix to patch 5.1, level 25 pets no longer soak XP. Feel free to
level lowbies with your 25s to your heart's content!

*What=E2=80=99s the highest level my pets can reach?*
Currently, 25 is the max level a battle pet can reach.

*My pet has reached level 10. How do I change what skills it can use in
battle? *
In the pet journal, add the pet whose moves you want to change to your team
(if they aren't already on your current team). On their top abilities
buttons you should see a little yellow downward pointing triangle. Click on
that to select a different move.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," *Any tips for leveling pets quickly?*
Aside from following the pet tamer questline and battling wild pets, there
are a few tricks.

One Pokemon standard is to start the fight with a low-level pet you wish to
powerlevel against higher level pets. That pet must perform an action in
order to credit =E2=80=93 merely having it out does not count. After your l=
ow-level
pet has done its duty, switch it out for a higher level pet and proceed to
knock out the wild pet(s). Alternately, swap in your low-level pet and then
immediately swap it out (obviously, need to time this just right in pet
battles!).

There are a few items in-game that will increase XP gain of battle pets.
The Safari Hat, obtained by completing the achievement ""Taming the World"",
will increase XP gain of pets by 10%.
Pet Treats will increase the XP gain by 50% for 1 hour and Lesser Pet
Treats increase the XP gain by 25% for 1 hour. All the pet XP boosts stack.
Pet Treats can drop from Tamer Bags or be purchased with either Celestial
Coins at the Timeless Isle or with Pet Charms.

Additionally, periodically there will be ""Bonus Pet XP"" weeks in WoW, where
all pets' XP gains are doubled. This is a fantastic time to level pets.
Again, all the XP boosts stack.

Finally, there are stones that increase levels (covered a little further
down in this guide).
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," *My minor child and I share a battle.net <http://battle.net> account. Will
we be able to pet battle each other?*
Unfortunately at the current time, Blizzard has made Pet Battles active on
only ONE WoW account per battle.net account. While every WoW account will
have access to Pet Battles (and share pets across accounts), only the first
account to log-in each play session will be able to use the Pet Battles
features. The rest of the WoW accounts will find that the Pet Journal is
locked.

If you are serious about wanting access at the same time on separate WoW
accounts, you will need to set-up additional battle.net accounts for each
WoW account you want simultaneous Pet Battle access on. The CSF forum (found
 http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1011699/ ) will better be able to help
you with any questions you have pertaining to moving WoW accounts and all.
Unfortunately, removing WoW accounts from a battle.net account means that
the moved WoW account will lose access to the shared pets, mounts, and
other BoA privilages (such as heirlooms).
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," *What are Pet Battles Stones?*
Pet Battles Stones are an item added by Blizzard with patch 5.1 that
enables you to upgrade the quality of your battle pet. There's two types of
stones: one which will upgrade the quality of pets and one that will
upgrade the level of pets.

Quality upgrades (Battle stones): Flawless Battle stones are rewarded for
completing some pet quests, can drop from some bosses, can be present in
tamer bags, and are available for purchase with either Celestial Coins or
Pet Charms. There's also Polished Battle stones (but they only upgrade to
uncommon and are pretty useless now).

Leveling stones (Battle-training stones): Currently, there are family
specific stones (which drop from battles/tamer battles and are also
available for purchase with Pet Charms), Flawless Battle-training stones
(which are awarded for completing Menagerie pet quests and available for
purchase with Pet Charms), and Fel-touched Battle-Training Stones, which
award 5 pet levels and drop from the Fel-Touched Pet Supplies, obtained by
battling the legendary pets in Tanaan Jungle.

*How do I obtain Pet Battles Stones?*
There are several ways, depending on the stone.

Polished Battle Stones are sold by Commander Lo Ping in the Niuzao Temple
in Townalong Steppes for 1000 JP. Again, these merely upgrade a pet to
uncommon and are pretty much a waste of JP. Do not buy these.

You can purchase a Marked Flawless Battlestone for 3 Celestial Coins
obtained from the Celestial Tournament on the Timeless Isle or at the
Garrison Menagerie for 15 Pet Charms.

Family Battle-training Stones are a *random* drop that you get from
battling wild pets or Pet Tamers. Mostly, wild pets will drop family
specific stones but can drop the general purpose (need to confirm this).
Also, some pets seem to have identity confusion and may drop a different
family stone. As of 5.4, you can turn 3 family specific stones (ex,
Flawless Beast Battle Stone) into one general purpose Flawless Battlestone.
Family battle-training stones are also available for purchase at the
Garrison Menagerie in the ""Mystery Bag"" for 2 pet charms (random which
family(s) you get). Flawless Battle-training stones are also available at
the Garrison for 3 pet charms.

Additionally, once a character has upgraded their Draenor garrison to level
3, they are given a quest outside their new Menagerie by either Lio the
Lioness (Alliance) or Serr'ah (Horde) to find a stone outside their
garrison mine. Completing this quest rewards the character with the
""Ultimate Battle-Training Stone"" , which will level any battle pet to 25.
This quest can be done on multiple characters.

Currently, Battle Stones *may* disappear from your inventory through the
magic of CRZ. If this happens to you, open a ticket to get it restored.

*How do I use a Battle Stone?*
To use one of these, you need to summon the pet in question, target it, and
then use the item. Clicking on the pet in the Pet Journal will not do
anything.

front!

Question: has anyone put any thought into compiling a ""rare spawn""
information sticky, with a listing of the pets that need special conditions
to be caught (ie, raining on the island for Baby Ape, daytime for Little
Black Ram, winter for Snowy Owl, etc)?

I would love to, but am finding that maintaining this thread is enough for
me and I don't feel comfortable as I don't know enough (been too busy
putting this thread together to level pets as much as I wanted - oh the
irony!).
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," First, I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. I ended up having
a fairly busy weekend.

Unfortunately, I do not have first hand knowledge about WoW accounts on the
same b.net account. I have a trial account I could try out, but I am
currently at work without access.

However, it's been reported that pets are b.net bound, so they *should* be
sharable. If you can, you can test this by setting up a
free-to-play/endless trial account and seeing if that account has access to
your current pets. If this works, RaF should work as well then.

If they're not, there are several possible solutions, depending on what
Horde specific pets you need. Do you need just the Argent Gruntling, Horde
balloon, and Horde guild pets? You can roll a DK on another server (since
they start out at higher level) and do your thing to get the pets you need.
Alternatively, you can...pay to faction switch one of your current toons
and find a Horde guild on your current server to fit your needs. Given the
cost of RaF (base account + 2 months of game time), this would probably
even out to cost the same.

I know the above are not the answers you're looking for, but they do exist
as solutions. If you do figure out an answer, please report back!

"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," First, you have to have a full version of the game (the endless trial
account is not eligible). Second, you have to have paid the 10 g to train
for Pet Battles and completed the initial quests the trainer sends you on.
Once you've completed that initial series of quests, you can go anywhere in
the world where little green paws show up on your mini-map (the paws
represent battle pets). During the battle with a wild battle pet, once you
knock that pet down to 35% health or lower (but don't knock them out
completely), your cage icon should light up. Then, it's a matter of luck if
the cage will actually capture the battle pet.
"
itaicohen266@gmail.com," Unrelated to your question: Timmain, from ElfQuest?

Answering your question: The Difficulty Bonus *should* be affecting the
amount of XP you get. If your pets are 2 levels below the pets you are
battling or take on 2 or 3 of the pets themselves, they should be getting
XP reflecting this bonus. When the battle is over and the XP flashes aboves
each pet's head, it should have this bonus XP built in. For example, I'll
have one pet get 49 XP and the other pet get 194 XP with the difficulty
bonus (note: that XP reflects the bonus xp being added in - it's not the
typical XP plus that number).

Keep in mind that the XP is still split amongst your surviving pets that
participated in the battle.

Are you not getting the proper amount of XP? Was it possible you were
adding the numbers wrong? If you were reading the numbers correctly and
your pets aren't level 25, you're experiencing a bug and should open a
ticket to report it.

itaicohen266@gmail.com," Without an Addon, there's no easy way, especially with low level pets.
You'd need to know how the H/P/S numbers relate for each pet to each breed.
For example, a S/S breed Snail will not have the same speed stat as a S/S
breed moth.

With level 1 pets, this is impossible because there is no real stat
differetiation. Even addons will get the level 1 breeds incorrect.

If you are serious about knowing breeds, an addon is highly suggested. I
don't think it's possible to do it without an addon unless you're Rainman
and/or have print-outs for every pet with the numbers.

asafdavid08@gmail.com,"So, as many of you know, I love my Switch. First and foremost, it's
portability makes for a great gaming experience.

That said, I'm not blind to some of its flaws. From it's screen resolution,
to it horsepower, to it's mostly plastic build; there are many areas where
Nintendo could improve the Switch.

With that said, how soon before we see Nintendo roll out an updated Switch?
And what changes do you expect or hope to see?
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Most of us a pretty happy with last year's phone purchase; be it a Pixel,
iPhone, Galaxy or something else.

Yet, try as they might, no OEM can produce a truly perfect phone. As
technology changes, some compromise presents itself. And as consumers, we
accept some of these to get as close to perfect as possible.

So, when you examine that piece of glass and metal in your hand, how would
you improve it?

Let's hear below.
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Welp....looks like Disney is gonna do it again.

Black Panther. Infinity War. Solo. Incredibles 2. Wreak It Ralph 2. Ant Man
and Wasp....

These films are gonna lead to another year of complete domination by the
House of Mouse.

I think the only film that may not see massive success is A Wrinkle in Time
and maybe The Nutcracker. But we'll see.

What Disney film are you most looking forward to?

asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Look....

I know things get dicey when we talk about ecosystems. Especially when they
are between Apple and Google. This is especially true after reading the
thread _silellak_ posted this past week or weekend.

Reading through it now, its as if people are suddenly audio experts.

Can we be real honest for a moment?

I don't need to have heard any of them to come to this conclusion:

They all sound great; with one maybe sounding a bit better than the others.

Does it really matter though? The things that make them unique are their
ability to use voice commands to do extra functions.

If any of us are truly looking for superior sound aren't going to buy a
smartspeakers. Plain and simple.

The Sonos, Google Home Max or the Apple HomePod will put out audio that is
truly beyond a fault.

The real discussion should be the features.

I hate to be the one to say this; but are we simply arguing sound quality
because Apple thinks that's what's most important? Or, because the HomePod
is lacking many features at launch?

Regardless, the HomePod will get more features as time goes on; just like
the Echo did.

It's really just making me scratch my head how crazy this is getting...
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Well, this escalated quickly.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2018/01/17/reporter-behind-ansari-story-criticizes-hln-hosts-looks-in-scathing-email/amp/

For those who may not follow the link, I'll try to paraphrase this:

Mrs. Banfield was against the tone, *NOT THE FACTS,* revolving around the
Aziz story written. She then voiced her opinions on air condemning the way
the story was delivered.

Again, *not the facts.*

Following that, Katie Way, the reporter at Babe.net, decided to fire back.
And she took some extremely low blows at Banfield; namely taking aim at her
age and looks.

It was...sad. And certainly beneath one who claims to be a feminist.

Now, it makes me wonder, how do those that support this article and it's
delivery, those that say arguments against it are a mess, feel knowing that
authors other side?
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"So, I don't need to tell any of you that there's been an extremely heighten
awareness of sexual harassment; especially in Hollywood.

One that's *long* overdue.

Yet, something was bothering me, and the latest claim against Aziz really
brings up an issue:

https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz-ansari-28355

I then read this article:

https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/the-humiliation-of-aziz-ansari/550541/

.......

I want to be completely honest. All the accounts in the #MeToo movement
aren't the same. And this particular story against Aziz is a bit of a
tipping point that I'm afraid may begin to hurt the entire movement.

It seems as though we have people jumping on the symbolic bandwagon.

While people should be fully held responsible for their foul, assualting
actions; but what about inaction?

During the Weinstein saga, like many, I was dumbfounded. How could so many
women have been lead into these situations.

Yet, as I researched a bit more, it turns out that many women, now famous
from their associations with Weinstein, knew full well that other young
aspiring actresses were walking into the same trap.

And I think that disgusted me just as much.

Why would you allow other women to be subjected to the same foul treatment?
Certainly you would mention to your neighbors and friends if you knew a
pedophile were lurking nearby! This is just as terrible.

Turns out, some women in Hollywood had indeed voiced their experiences, but
were mostly ignored. Yet, the important part was that they had voiced it in
the public! Some put out a warning.

Again, I want to be clear: This in no way brushes aside the actions of men
who misuse their celebrity or power to gain what they want.

But I can shake the feeling that standing there and taking it....is
strange. And bordering on stupid.

There are plenty of women around the world who simply wouldn't stand around
for this behaviour. My sister's, wife and numerous female friends are
equally stunned by these situations.

Going to meet strange men alone at night, standing around while men
masterbate in front of them...

Why? Is your potential career more important than your dignity or respect?

I don't believe any men is these forums would absolve another man of this
behaviour. But those of you with daughters; certainly you've trained your
girls that this is unacceptable and they should immediately leave, run or
flee if they encounter unwanted sexual advances.

My daughter is 4yrs old and my wife and I have already discussed, and
continue to discuss with her that no one should touch her in certain
places. What decent parent hasn't?

Yet, what is happening when people grow older? Some obviously retain these
lessons. Others seem to be ignoring it.

I've always believed that when a situation is in your control, you need to
take responsibility for what follows. Because in life there are going to be
many instances where you don't have control.

I may be rambling in some of this post. Maybe some of my thoughts aren't
being clearly communicated.

But I want to hear the thoughts of others in this community. There are a
variety of people here that differ from maybe those in my immediate circle.

How do some of you feel about the entirety of the recent flood of
accusations? Do you feel all are legimate? Are some just jumping on the
bandwagon?

Also, do you feel that all the accusations leveled at those in power will
remedy the situation? Could it backfire?

Please....please keep this civil. I really want us to have a decent
discussions that respects others opinions. *(Unless that opinion suggests
that sexual harassment is okay. If so, you're a piece of crap and don't
bother commenting.)*

Thanks.
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"I now need a new tablet. I'm simply not going to spend upwards of $300 for
a screen replacement when I can spend just a bit more and get a new one.

My first thought, of course, was just get another iPad. Perfectly
reasonable assessment. The iPad is hands down the best *pure* tablet by a
long shot. In fact, outside of buying the failed Motorola Xoom at launch,
and promptly switching to the iPad 2 7 or so months later; or the time I
tried out a Surface 3, I haven't seriously considered trying anything else.

But things have now changed. I wanna try something different.

After leaving behind my iPhone and Apple Watch and inserting myself back
into Android, now seems to be a great time to do so.

The question is simply what to get.

My options are the following:

Windows 10 detectables or Chromebook 2-n-1's *(at least until some OEM
unleashes a true Chrome OS tablet)*

My budget is $600; let's hear your suggestions below.

Let's go!
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com," Wow...just wow...This game is crazy. And huge. So freaking huge!

I'm 20 hours in and I'm still getting lost on these Titans. Here's my
breakdown of Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

First, this game is not for those who want something they can play in very
small chunks. It is a pretty deep JRPG and requires/seizures your attention
for long periods of time. To get the most from this title you must devote
some time to learning it's ins and outs.

Over the course of the first 10+ hours, you're going to have information
feed to you. Most importantly, those involving combat. Clicking through
these tutoriorls because you think you understand will result in you
promptly being destroyed by your enemies.

The world of Alrest feels as though it is literally seeking your utter
destruction for any and every failure. Time attacks incorrectly and you may
leave your foe with just enough life to lay down a world of hurt upon you.

Regarding combat: It's superb. The learning curve can be steep though. You
have such a wealth of options at your diposal that it can overwhelm you.
Elements, weapons, directional stances, etc....your mind will be working
overtime to figure out what your next step in battlefield should be and you
don't have very long to decide.

Xenoblade fights require you to be not just quick thinking, but divisive.

The HUD during combat is another aspect that can be a bit much. Especially
if you were again, the type of person to ignore the tutorials. It is
information overload.

Watch your parties health, watch you characters auto attack timing, watch
you special abilities, watch your enemies attacks, watch for status changes
in the enemies.

Your eyes need to be trained to take this all in and be able to act upon it
in an instance.

The amount of damage you can deliver is huge if you are prepared. It can
greatly reduced the amount of time your fighting an opponent.

Combat is something that Xenoblade does very well. It makes you feel like a
pro when you successfully bring down a for due to your skill. Something you
don't always get from a game.

Next up is exploration.

As I mentioned earlier, the world of Xenoblade is humongous! It makes the
land of Hyrule in BotW look downright bleak and empty. Towns are full of
people and feel alive with activity. So many shops to spend your money on
to prepare for combat. Numerous NPCs to speak with to not only learn about
this world, but also what's happening in it and actually advancing it's
abilities to assist you later.

Outside of the towns, the landscape is simply beautiful. The areas vary
greatly from lush jungles to sandy deserts. Branching paths usually reward
you for simply exploring.

But while the towns and landscapes are wonderful, the guiding arrow to
complete missions is borderline a deal breaker. Seriously, this thing is
useless unless your on a level area. Alrest is wide, tall and full of nooks
and crannies. If you aren't up for looking behind every corner, checking
every hole, you'll miss you stop.

My advice: You better listen to whoever is giving you an assignment because
simply following the arrow at the top of the HUD will drive you insane.

Finally, the story. I won't spoil anything here, but I will say that it's
very good so far. Probably not the deepest thing out there, but certainly
entertaining. Leans heavily into ideas and mannerisms found in many
Japanese mangas. If you like those things, you throughly enjoy yourself.

To sum up, I'd say this game is certainly worth the price of admission.
Zelda kicked off the Switch launch properly, and Xenoblade is giving the
huge assist to finish off Nintendo's efforts in 2017.

Xenoblade has kicked my tail to the point that sometimes I want to just put
the controller down. But those times I successfully pull off a combo of
epic proportions...it just reels me back in.

So, what do you all think of XC2?

Let's discuss below!
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"We live tech. We breath tech. We use tech.

pleasure to use daily.

Sound off below!
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Can we just take a moment and be honest? The DCEU is a mess; plain and
simple.

I don't want this post to be a MCU vs DCEU debate. To be fair, the MCU has
plenty of issues of its own. There a few problems with continuity, some of
the films aren't great, villians are mostly forgettable, etc.

Despite these issues though, the MCU has a common thread that has made it's
movies must watch for many; especially the average moviegoer.

The DCEU though...its problems are deeper than what's on the screen.

From the producers, directors, screenwriters...If you can't get the
situation right behind the camera, how can you expect to put a good film on
screen?

Wonder Woman is a good/great film, but it's measured against it's
stablemates, which helps it to look even better.

Man of Steel was decent/good. It's problem was being _too_ dark for the
coming out of a new Superman film.

Suicide Squad was meh/decent. Problem here is, we didn't need this film yet.

Finally: Batman vs Superman was bad/meh. This film had way too many issues
and even the most advent DC fan can see that; especially when they compare
it back to Wonder Woman.

Having too many hands in the kitchen has wrecked the DCEU and the attempts
to right the ship with Justice League doesn't seem to be helping a lot.

Is it maybe time to just scrap what's on the table for Warner Bros and just
restart?

At least by going back to the beginning, a single head can help churn out a
consistent vision with none of the problems of trying to stitch together
these previous films.

DC characters are too well known to be saddled with such films. Superman,
Batman, Wonder Woman all deserve better than this.
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Wow....just wow!

The Switch has really come into its own this first year. Launching with
BotW, followed by Mario Odyssey was certainly a great plan.

But now, Nintendo intends to end the year on another high note:

Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

I can't state just how pleased I am with Nintendo's efforts. Each of these
games alone will fill weeks of your time if you spend the time exploring.

Personally, I've always been a fan of single player campaigns, so this
lineup appeals to me, but probably not to those who enjoy online play.

Regardless, I think Nintendo is a perfect compliment to either an X Box or
Playstation owner.

How do you feel about the Switch and it's first year lineup? Confident they
can continue to deliver the goods?
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"So, the gist is that someone is going to remedy the saturation issue that's
been plaguing the Pixel 2's display. Granted, it doesn't address the more
serious issues some users may be experiencing.

Regardless, for those like me with no major display problems, this will be
much appreciated.

My single issue with my 2 XL is the muted colors. While I don't notice in
normal usage too often...as soon as I see my 6P, it's obvious.

Here's hoping this upcoming app helps!
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Could some of you who purchased an iPhone 8 please explain why you did so?

I simply can't fathom why you wouldn't wait for the clearly superior
iPhone: the iPhone X. It contains all the things that make a new phone
exciting: new (though questionably ugly) design, beautiful AMOLED screen,
more advanced cameras, etc. It's the iPhone that is more forward thinking
and helps push it's competition.

My personal opinion is that the iPhone 8 is simply a warmed over device
that certainly doesn't deserve to have increased even slightly in price.
And while the X is a bit too expensive, I can at least understand and see
legitimate changes.

So why did you spend your money on the inferior iPhone and not wait for the
clearly better one?
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"So, lets see if we can pin down what the table stakes seem to be for our
mobile phones:

1. Greatly reduced bezels.

2. Water proof.

3. AMOLED display.

4. Great camera.

It would seem that if you have these things, you're golden. The iPhone X,
Google Pixel 2, Galaxy Note8 and LG V30 seem to share these things in
common.

Now, what about extras?

1. Wireless charging.

2. Headphone jack.

While not table stakes, they are important to many users. This is an area
where only LG and Samsung have made a clear attempt to keep both. Sorry
Apple and Google. You may miss a few sales omitting one or both of these.

Finally:

1. Pricing.

This is a point of contention. Spending nearly a grand on a phone is wild.
I damned Apple for it and Samsung and Google dont get a pass. This is
getting ridiculous. Plain and simple. *At least one can make a hefty profit
reselling the iPhone X*.

That said, I can honestly say I'm glad that we have such a great selection
of phones this fall. We'll continue to nitpick over minor things, but
regardless of which you pick, you should be happy.
"
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"The best way to retain customers in a product driven market like mobile is
a strong or even mix of software, hardware and services.

asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Check out this article:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/chromeunboxed.com/google-eve-new-laptop-patent-chromebook/amp/

Now, it brings up a lot of points regarding the Chromeboom Eve. But my
focus is the design itself. It addresses the major flaw many 2n1s face:

No one likes touching the letter keys when in tablet mode.

It still boggles my mind that OEMs still make laptops that do this. It's a
usability nightmare. Laptops are still generally heavier than your basic
tablet or iPad. Why combine that extra weight with the feeling of pressing
keys when you're holding the device in its alternate mode?

So, Google seems to be looking at a way around it, but still leaving the
keyboard attached.

Granted, both Google and Microsoft have tried different approaches to this.
They've each created devices that separate the screen from the keyboard.
But this still results in some compromises. The Surface Pro requires a
kickstand and has stability issues when used on your lap. And the Pixel C
was top heavy to an extent.

In their defense though, you could at least detach the Keyboards and flip
them so as to not encounter the issues of most other 2n1s.

Do you imagine that Google could pull off a relatively thin and light
weight Chrome OS laptop as it's designed in the patent? One that hides the
keys beneath a cover hinge that also acts as a touch pad?

asafdavid08@gmail.com,"So, should Apple go all in on using eye/facial recognition to supplant
Touch ID, do you believe they'll continue to attempt to embed a fingerprint
sensor under the display?

Honestly, it wouldn't make much sense to me.

A hands free solution, that's followed up by a method that requires
touching to unlock on a future device seems backwards. Once you move
forward with a new technology like eye/facial recognition, especially if
it's the primary source of security, it would seem an admission of failure
to say, 'Hey, Touch ID was really better...Let's just go back to that.'

What do you imagine Apple will do?

Part of me wonders if they'll just add the sensor to the power button. As
far as I know, no major players in the US implement the fingerprint sensor
there, so to an extent, it would be more or less unique to the iPhone. (I'm
fully aware Sony does this, but they still disable that sensor in the US.)

It also makes me wonder about the iPads future. Would future tablets
implement the 'Face ID'? Is Apple going to remove the button from it as
well?

*2. Are some going to simply fail due to not having enough diversity of
content?*

*3. Or worse, will we eventually be forced back into the archaic cable
television model of old?*

Honestly, I'm not gonna pay for more than 3 services. And I don't imagine
many of you will either. If the idea was to keep people from

asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Since it's widely regarded as the best smartphone camera, in what ways do
you imagine Google can improve on its camera?

Last year's specs:

   - 1/2.3"" 12MP CMOS sensor with 1.55=C2=B5m pixels
   - F2.0 aperture
   - AF with on-sensor phase detection and laser-assistance
   - Dual-tone LED flash
   - 4K video at 30 fps
   - 1080p slow-motion at 120fps, 720p at 240fps
   - Manual controls and Raw-support with third-party camera apps
   - Gyroscope-based video stabilization
   - 8MP front camera, 1/3.2"" sensor, 1.4 =C2=B5m pixels, F2.4, 1080p video
   - Unlimited cloud storage for full-resolution images and videos

Now, rumors suggest that Google isn't going to bother with dual cameras at
this time. Which means they will no doubt put their full efforts into
making the software do the heavy lifting. And if last year's camera is the
measurement stick, then it's easy to expect that Google could easily repeat
it's efforts.

believe that it is actually a great summer blockbuster.

I want to believe that this female directed film is good, not just for
being overseen by a woman, but because much love and time was put into
elevating the status of a strong female character.

But...I just don't know.

I can't help but to think back to all the hype the new Ghostbusters
received and I become a bit jaded.

So many articles were written on how fantastic the talent was for that
movie. How that an all female cast would do so wonderfully and shut up all
the haters.

And then we got the film...And it was relatively a flop.

And now we have WW. It's just too bad she has to carry the weight of 3 past
films that have varied between 'alright' (MoS) to okay (Suicide Squad) to
terrible (BvS).

That's a lot of pressure to be under...Even for the shoulders of one of
comics strongest and most beloved characters.

in many cases, completely fallen.

asafdavid08@gmail.com,"So, it appears that maybe we're headed toward a future of Star Wars films
where the Jedi, Sith and the Force begin to take a back seat.

Maybe I'm just reading too much into the newest trailer, but it makes me
cringe.

In my opinion, Star Wars is nothing without force users; those that use it
for evil and those who stand against them. It's basically a generic space
odyssey, a poor mans Star Trek.

Ive never watched a Star Wars film for bounty hunters, galactic politics,
foot soldiers clad in white or anything else. I've watched solely because
of those champions of good wielding swords made of light and making use of
an unknown mystic force against foes who, on the surface, appear to be evil.

If Luke Skywalkers comment about the Jedi ending means that they are going
to simply evolve, than I'm cool with that.

But if it means that all connections to the Force are going out the
window...I'm done.

I already had hostile feelings about The Force Awakens and its copy and
paste method of apeing A New Hope. (Seriously, Finn would've been a better
Jedi character as his life experience of being a Storm Trooper was
something we hadn't seen in film before. We've already seen a lonely
outcast character living on a desert planet rise to prominence )

Ending Force users would be a blow to my investment in Star Wars.

But who knows...maybe I'm jumping the gun. Maybe I'm overthinking the
context. I certainly hope so.

dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I love the way you write! It sounds really verbal! Very nice of you to sign
up to reply. How weird is this though; I didn't think I had paranoia but
you almost sound like my little sister! I know you're not, but in my head
I'm beginning to wonder whether I should write on here!

I probably do have depression, I acknowledge that. I think my personality
might not help but I agree, depression is likely. I have social anxiety, I
over think far too much, I have mild symptoms of OCD, I have some body
issues, I hide my trichotillomania well being male (face) and I'm somewhat
of a perfectionist or idealist - if I could have done it better then it was
crap.

Genetically speaking there doesn't seem to be any history of it in my
family. Because of the way my last job blew up, my parents became more
aware of the situation. That's not to say they were completely blind to it,
but it became more of a discussion. My parents have both had depression due
to work but were fine before and after the event that caused it (tribunals
etc) but they don't really understand the 'lack of reason' side of it. I
shared with them for a while, on both ups and downs, but got the impression
it was upsetting them so have largely stopped talking about it. I never
mentioned suicide to them. Again, due to the situation my older sister
became aware and she too pressed a little but there is a limit you want to
talk about things when all it does is upset people and they can't help you
anyway. I have not talked about it with other family members. I'm already
known as the depressing one, so I try to sound super happy when I'm around
family now. I was told that the reason I'm, at least subconciously, left
out in family gatherings is because I'm quiet/ serious/ boring (actual
terms!). I'm aware they'd care if I wasn't here - most people are
genetically programmed to protect their kin, but my absence would make no
difference really. I now spend Xmas away from family, I'm fairly sure
they're happier for it! I hate being a chore. I love your statement about
it being 'disgusting sweet s*t' - that's so very much my style, even in the
depths it's very much black humour, sarcasm etc - struggle with sweet stuff!

Outside my family there is just my girlfriend. That sounds extreme, but
it's really not. I don't have a single other friend, that is equally my
fault. But I talk to no one from University days, no ex colleagues etc. I
know no-one else. Partially I like it that way, it's easy and I don't feel
like a burden, on the other hand I feel like some of them could have fought
to 'look after me' - they all gave up very easily. I know that's not fair.
You shouldn't test your friends. But on the other hand, if I really cared
for someone and knew they were struggling emotionally, I'd put in a little
more effort. I wasn't ever mean or snappy with them, I just kind of
disappeared. But it's not their job to understand mental issues, they have
their own busy lives with their own problems.

So I sometimes speak to my girlfriend, less so these days though. When it
all hit the fan I had no choice but to share everything with her, not that
it was brand new information of anything - I've been with her for a long
time. But maybe the intensity of the feelings was new, of the fact they
were always there. But again, there's very little she can do so why depress
her. I don't want to see her cry because of me. So I've largely stopped
talking about things, in a way that might give her the impression I'm
improving. Occasionally stuff slips out, or I sarcastically mention
'leaving' but I cover it well now. I still tell her to find someone else, I
cover it in a light/jokey way but, although I'm not stupid and I know she
sees though it, it is kind of an acceptable level of sharing.

You're right about social anxiety too. That I fully recognise. I care way
more than I should, or want to, about others thoughts. Doesn't stop it
though. I do analyse everything I've said and done before and after events
but I can't forget it - really stupid example; I still remember saying
something that was taken the mick out of at school, probably really mildly,
and that was about twenty five years ago! How the hell can I get over this
when I still stew over stuff I said when I was 9?!

Despite seeing every flaw in myself I don't take criticism well, not in a
grumpy way but in a defeatest way. If I'm told a million things are good
but 'this' needs improving then it was an awful experience. I know that is
both ridiculous and common but want it stop effecting me so much. In
complete contrast I am very patient and forgiving of others, I'll always
see the other side of the argument and I'll happily give people as much
time as they need. I'm the epitomy of 'do as I say, not as I do!'. I know
where I'm going wrong, I know my thought processes are messed up, but I
just don't know how to fix them. I can't think of many situations where
I've felt 'better' than anyone else - the closest I get it wondering why
horrible people in this world are more likely to succeed; stupidity is
rewarded (TOWIE type), rudeness is applauded (Cowell), stabbing people in
the back is relabled 'ambition', and generous people get walked on and
criminals win the lottery!

I'm really happy you've started to figure your life out. You sound very
intelligent and in control. You also mentioned being in school so I suspect
you are quite young; for you to have such a good grip on your feelings and
recognise triggers and mental health issues is quite impressive. Is it an
avenue you have interest in? I'm genuinely happy you have got such a grip
on it early, understanding it early may help you in the long run - I don't
know, but I suspect the longer this is left the harder it is to undo the
'learning to hate yourself' that is embedded in to you. Much like whe I
used to teach, the longer you left a mistake/misconception with a child the
harder it was to 'unteach' it - so I just have 34 years to unteach
myself! [image:

Fair enough, I don't do much at the moment. I occasionally do a little bit
of exercising (jogging/cycling) but a grey cloud, real or metaphorical,
quickly kills any energy I have! I don't think it's the lack of doing
anything that causes this however, I'm still 'better' than when I was at
work/ socialising - but then if this is the best it gets... well.

I have visitied the Doctor, and for the record he was really nice. Very
supportive in fact. But it didn't change the fact I felt stupid and as if I
was wasting his, and others, time. I remember being really worked up about
the fact our appointment slot was overunning because I felt like I was
holiding up other people. But I did that because my girlfriend was with me
at all times (and forced me!) and because I needed to get a Doctors note
for work. Now I no longer work, I no longer need to waste people's time.
But you're right, I'm an expert in giving up!

The girlfriend question comment is a difficult one and the one I battle
every day more than anything else. If I leave her there is nowhere to go,
that really is it. I mean that in the practical sense here, house etc but
also it means that really is the end. I stay through her appeals and for
maybe that ounce of hope that she, and others, are right that it'll pass.
Although I've always been like this. I'm not staying with her for ease, or
to string her along, but leaving her really is a final decision - I have no
belief there is something better than her. Probably makes no sense. The 1%
hope keeps me alive, therefore the 1% keeps me here. If I lose the here, I
have absolutely zero interest in the alive.

I really do appreciate your replies, a constructive kick is better than a
compassionate hug for me. But I can't find that kick that I can't talk my
way around or explain away. I hate my head! I have actually tried
everything I'm supposed to, maybe not for long enough, but I've seen zero
difference. Leaving work calmed me down and made me able to uncurl from a
ball but does that mean I can never return to a job? That then creates
different problems emotionally and financially.

I saw the CBT guy but, nice as he was, he tried a religious route with me
(never going to work) and I put on my fake chatty character for the hour,
even if I was tired afterwards. It didn't do anything. Even if I try to get
refered again by the Doctor, I'd actually be scared that I'd be seeing him
again, or be seen to have asked not for him - and although I'm fairly sure
he wouldn't care, it genuinely freaks me out! How messed up is that?!

I'm actually ok, if I prepare well, for an hour or so around people - I can
seem easy going and chatty, any longer than that and it gets difficult. If
I can't prepare, i.e. I know there will be questions I'm not expecting or
it's someone I feel who will judge me e.g. a car mechanic as a 'guy' then I
can't do it. How silly is this - I still get uneasy surrounded by teenage
girls! I'm not in the remotest bit interested in them obviously, but just
the feeling of inadequacy/ that I'm a loser makes me feel 'weird'. Same
with family, there is a duration before it gets too personal; I can feel
myself being overly happy and lively around them as if it's all pouring out
on first meeting them but that there is a finite amount and then my energy
drops and I disappear.

Grrr.... I'm whining again. Shoot me.
