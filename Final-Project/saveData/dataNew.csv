dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Im not even sure I have depression I think this may just be me. I have always been pretty useless socially but have had a normal upbringing no horrible experiences have gone through education fine and even got jobs but Ive never enjoyed life never really cared and normally feel like Im not really worth anything and inevitably enventually will become a burden. Im not going to be dramatic and say Im going to end it it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of going or even dreams that I could die blamelessly thorugh accident or illness. Selfish I know. I have a cycle. Get job put on confident easy going persona get physically tired from doing that lose energy to maintain job focus on negative leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same play easy going fun cant keep it up lose or push them away. Relationships get attracted to ones who need help help them in anyway I can get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as theyd be ultimately better off. So currently Ive quit my job as a teacher couldnt take it always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you youre useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I dont think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt Id let everyone down so disappeared my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough put me on medication which seemed to do very little even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like its doing nothing at all either we talk Im honest as I can be but there is some element of being public and putting on that face/ jokey responses. I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my theories are proved. I know this sounds odd but I dont even have the will to get better largely because I dont think I can. I am just me. I am negative boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies its still me who has done that. Im not blaming life or others or anything else. A lot of the posts I read on here seem to have good reason PTS loss finances etc does anyone have no good reason? I just feel Im never going to be happy I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that in the long run itd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me but time heals life would get better and people move on. In the long run Im sure it wouldnt effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off. Not sure if there is an answer for this just writing. Im not angry Im not hurt Im not even sad as such Im just tired...
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,What a fantastic answer but also a really bad one!! Let me explain... Firstly Im very pleased to see you are happy and treat every day as a gift. Obviously Im sorry you have such daily physical problems but Im sure that makes you even happier you did the skydiving when you did. Im really pleased what you did worked for you and its encouraging to find a rare example of someone who has somewhat defeated depression even if the cost of that has been quite extreme. But then on the same hand not recognising how lucky I am isnt th e problem its knowing that I am and Im still not feeling good which then further compounds how bad I feel about myself. I know Im luckier than most I know things could be worse I live in an affluent country with water on tap have good health and had a normal upbringing with no major traumas. So knowing this makes me feel EVEN worse about myself. I see Im selfish and ungrateful and petty and all other words why cant I just be happy? Ive put my life on the line a few times both within the safety c onfines of organised activities and on the less controlled activities I may do myself it doesnt help me. Being near death doesnt impact me positively or negatively Im almost apathetic to it. And this is why your answer is both fantastic and bad! For you an d others it may work. You are obviously an inspiration to lots of people not only for the physical issues (which are almost a separate issue) but for the fact you have altered your way of thinking in a positive manner. But they also highlight how everyones issues are unique and as well intentioned and even correct your view that it could be worse it that can actually make people feel worse. If we all focused on it could be worse theyd be very few people in this world who could complain unfortunately its not that simple. This depression doesnt care that Im lucky it just cares that I think badly of myelf and reminds me of it every day and actually accelerates when I speak to people who could argue they do have a good reason to feel bad. I know I dont and that makes it even worse. Thanks for your reply I hope I didnt come across aggressively! I m very happy that you are happy and hope things improve if thats possible for you. Good luck have a great Christmas and a lovely New Year.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,I had a few people on her write to me over Xmas/ New Year but needed to ignore them too much energy was needed to focus on acting happy and normal around family! I wish I could talk to you more directly than on an open forum. I ve said before knowledge is a great thing but it can also be a curse. You need to be particuarly careful selfdiagnosing but also need to think whether this diagnosis is in any way helpful to you. Say you decide that you are HFAS how does that help you? If you cant source help then it is just another meaningless semantic for feeling awful day to day. Ive also mentioned that it is probably important to get outside y our own head think about doing things that stop you thinking about yourself. However as a caveat I also recognise doing anything (like talking to another human being as you rightly point out!) can be extrememly stressful. Id never pick holes in others punctuation and grammar unless they were doing it to others! Its a forum not a thesis! However if you have the time and pride to check your message back then maybe you do have the time to look at HFAS if it interests you. To be honest knowledge is something I despise yet am addicted to so I will inevitably be searching HFSA after Ive written this reply! But without an argument or focus it is impossible to really research a topic to any purpose. I will happily help others if I can (preferably from afar!) but not sure what I could do to focus your research on this matter and whether itd even be of any benefit to you anyway. Like I said there is certainly an interesting discussion to be ha d but unfortunately I doubt this is the place to do it effectively for you or I. Good Luck.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Quick research scan read. Told you I would... I definitely dont have HFSA. You may well have but itd take more than a quick chat to establish that. As Im sure youre aware everyone is somewhere on the autistic sp ectrum and all the various labels that spin off that. Even the most normal of people might feel particuarly calmed by a colour or get irritated by a simple tapping noise. The issues arise when your quirks impact on your life. Mine do for me and yours sound like they do for you. I have had a ton of labels I have both researched or been told abo ut that might fit my ways of thinking and acting but the conclusion I reached was that it was all kind of pointless a label by its very nature is just a broad title to fit many people and when that comes to the brain its a very pointless exercise. You might be able to group broken limbs in patients but with the head its nearly impossible theres too many bits that do or dont apply for every individual. Ultimately a title is only helpful to point you in the right direction to get you personalised help. And it HAS to be personalised. I think I have depression with social anxiety. I have signs of bi polar I get symptoms of SAD I have trichotillomania I have mild OCD that gets worse if Im stressed I have panic attacks I over think everything I have low selfesteem and no confidence I feel suicidal most days and a million other minilabels. Doesnt help me though. Its the classic whats in a name? I hope you see my point. We sound very similar yet I would class m yself as a people pleaser I rarely sure emotion outside the house and am overly polite to even strangers. So whilst HFSA might apply in parts it doesnt solve everything. Think about what you want from this title. How will it help you? Y ou might be better focusing on the things that make you feel better not labelling something that makes you feel bad. Good luck.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,I doubt you have no one family is only one part. Work friends? Neighbours? But for the sake of discussion if there is really noone then in a way you know how to feel better and that gives you a lot of power. I dont even know how to be happy and feel I should leave those around me before I drag them down too! If you feel lonely then be a little more proactive join some clubs or groups etc. Without being offensive you are a little older than me and there are a lot more clubs set up for your age group than mine that wouldnt be intimidating. I get expectations of sports clubs (loud bravado people!) or nightclubs etc where as Im sure there are more suitable groups for you. Knowing what you want to make you happy is a great thing. As for your family you seem to want nothing to do with them. Great! Sorry people on here may say thats sad etc or to try but its your situation if you simply dont get on then absolutely forget them. People survive without families all the time. Or you mentioned the recluse maybe you need each other... I sympathise in case that didnt come across so whilst I appreciate I have one on you by having a partner (although that can make you feel worse by the way in that you feel like a burden) you also have one on me knowing what will make you happy. You dont need family/partner to feel loved. In fact familys love often feels more because youre family than out of want. Friends are there purely because they want to be.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Hi Hypercat I really didnt mean any offence I just meant you have more access to such activities due to your age. I bet most of the people in those activities you talk of are of similar age and are in similar situations due to unemployment retirement etc. You may well be the youngest there but Im sure you have plenty in common with them. In fact Im envious! All I was trying to say is there isnt that social world more mid 30 year olds youre kind of expected to be all sociable and loud. My one friend tried to get me to go to a craft course hes ten years older than me and he was youngest be 10 years! It doesnt mean its not pleasant to some degree but you do feel very odd one out I apologise if I jumped to conclusions based on your message but I maintain that with the active social life you live you have LOADS of people who would miss you. Love is not exclusively available from family and partners. You seemed to suggest this was why you were largely unhappy so I think you know what makes you tick you miss a partner/ family bonds. Im not going to be stupid enough to say fix it then as its never that simple but knowing what would make you happy is a positive at least it gives you a target.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Great message. Funnily enough I am/was a teacher too but I think the environment is particularly toxic for those with is style of thinking (the profession is based around you/ the work never being good enough and what can you do to improve in the UK) Catch 22 means that once this impacts you to the degree I had to quit my job it means you cut off a social group and have no money for new experiences/ days out. As regards you Id stay in Australia! I imagine its a lot nicer when you have a crappy day opening the curtains to sunshine! Tthatd make a little but significant difference. Im not sure what Ill do now think teaching is gone cant see what I can do to keep me sane as a career and find very little point in most things. I go to CBT but it just feels like were talking about philosophy my way of thinking hasnt changed one iota. I had no reasons to think this way I created them almost. Now I actually have no job etc. I am not a victim I did it to myself. I think I have just given up if I see 2015 I will be a little surprised as I imagine something will come along in next few months that will be enough to knock me fully over the edge an unexpected bill a worry how Im impacting on my partner a death in the family something...
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,I do love travelling but now having just had to quit work it isnt even possible for me to save at all. Besides my gf still has a job so Im taking on my full time job of being a burden Everything you write makes perfect sense. But the most relevant part is the tone you seem to know everything isnt perfect but know your triggers and that there is good and bad. I was joking about staying in Oz I fully recognise complications regarding family etc. Fortunately or unfortunately I now have no friends no job limited family (that I see rarely anyway) so am not tied to any geographical place. Its just gfs job that keeps me where I am. I just struggle with people so much that I need a job that has little interaction. Dont get me wrong most people would see me as easy going relaxed even funny at work but it is all such a tiring act I can never maintain it. I just spend my time thinking they dont really like me or they think Im an idiot or that Im crap at my job. Think I just need to be a recluse!
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"We certainly have strong similarities you seem to be a lot further along in your understanding of you and your triggers though. Going to Australia in the first place is quite an acheivement and you must be doing something right! I too only really get enjoyment from helping others the issue comes that when that problem is solved I feel of no use and begin to withdraw. I have done it with friends and family. My girlfriend is a case in point she had relationship financial and work issues and I helped her solve all of these to be in a better place to the point now she considers everything to be pretty good in those departments but I have nothing left to offer her. Worse still I am now only going to be a burdn on her financially and emotionally and can offer her no decent future prospects. All that swims in my head is ""if you love them let them go"" as staying with her seems very selfish. However she is the first person who I have ever really shared this with. My past relationships completed the cycle! She understands as much as one can and is very supportive but I feel that her patience must run out eventually (shes a teacher so she does have a lot!) and she shouldnt have to deal with this anyway. If I were you Id visit America. Not sure where youre going but if you have the means then do it. If nothing else it is something to look back on one day and think wow I did that and gives you that ton more of info to talk about with friends strangers future partners that can fill those awkward moments when youre not sure what to say! Youve lived abroad nearly everyone would say thats pretty cool! Cheers for the offer of a drink ha ha! But Im so crap Id probably just put it off and hope to be left alone! The lovely thing about the internet is it is so anonymous even I dont mind being honest. The second I meet someone Im worrying Im boring them annoying them etc! Even my CBT doc! I wish I could find just one positive to focus on. I really cant. The only one I should have (my gf) I twist to make it one of the biggest negatives me being a burden to her. Im not fun Im not confident I now have no job I have cr*p future financially I can never acheive in basic things like house buying etc (Ive never even owned a car in my name!) because every time I get myself on an even keel I sabotage it best I can waiting for the disaster to hit. Cheers for the replies."
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Thanks for the reply its nice to know youre not alone isnt it? However itd be nicer if people said it got any better! I hate the idea that this is forever like an alcoholic or something! I hope you havent given up I dont know how you just get over it for good or bad! I have no spiritualty (I almost envy those who do!) so am under no illusions that it gets better after life but much like someone in constant physical pain I feel like I should be allowed to just give up without guilt. I fully empathise with your issues they sound identical! I beat myself up a little more as being a man society expects you to step up think I get weird looks when the gf is dealing with everything! I wish you luck with your future too I hope you are doing something to try and fight it as I think without at least trying Meds/ Talk therapy etc then giving up in your head can easily turn in to giving up properly.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I have read the replies and sympathise with you all despite it being some time since I wrote the original post. Unfortunately little changes. Paulsinbc you sound very similar! Im impressed you can volunteer I struggle with people and then somehow feel worse as I think I should be able to cope compared to people who have REAL problems. Ive never felt hard done by or unfortunate my problems are me! However youre right there is an element of fanning the flames! The reason Ive largely stopped looking at this site is I dont see a benefit for me or anyone else. I recognise some may get comfort from support from like minded people or signposted to suitable resources or recognise symptoms of PTS or similar but for me all I read is people who live with it forever with no answers and that in itself is depressing. People say knowledge is power but I find it to be a curse. The more you know the more you realise your insignificance the hopelessness of situations and the reality of the world rather than the rosetinted itll all work out in the end view were told to believe. I really struggle with the inability of professionals to accept that some people dont succeed some people do fail some people arent talented some people arent nice why cant that be me? Its no different than saying ""it cant happen to me"". So for that reason Im very much keeping this site at arms length. Id unrealistically hoped for advice or signposting or ridiculously a miracle cure but its more a gathering for people to support each other with knowing nods or virtual hugs. I recognise the support that may give to others but for me it just makes me feel worse."
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,What is it with my compulsion to reply despite my last comment?! Yeah 8 months feels both more and less. Unfortunately I doubt I will either give you insightful answers or even a nice positive slant on my response you have been warned! Little has changed. I tried drugs didnt work I tried therapy too much religion and not willing to try again a weird catch 22 in where you need to ask for help but are afraid of talking to people even day to day. Friends are nonexistent I quit my job and havent returned. I still feel like a burden to those around me and how ever much they care it doesnt excuse it in fact it makes it worse. I cant escape feeling that if I was a good person then Id protect them from me if you were highly infectious with a deadly disease would you hug your family? So internally and externally very much status quo. Im still here slightly surprisingly. It is fair to say Im confused as to my wants and beliefs about my situation. One day its just me and there is no hope next day its wont please someone give me a magic wand (but I wont ask!). If I seem ungrateful with any responses then that wasnt my intention maybe its my way I always focus on negative and all I see is lots of people struggling and noone coming out the other side. It feels like the blind leading the blind. Further more most people seem to have a good reason through circumstance or substance abuse or dramas in their life Im just like this for no real reason. Pretty pathetic really. My girlfriend does support me but it both helps me survive and yet stops me facing my issues and makes me feel not good enough and as if Im holding her back. I know she doesnt feel that but I feel like it MUST or it will eventually when she realises what shell miss out on. Cycles of mood are continuous but rarely hit a positive slant some days Im just ok and potter around and others I feel the strongest urge to give up. The only trigger I know doesnt help (but isnt crucial) is the weather but thats common with lots of people. A bad day will turn in to a bed day easily if its grey! Lucky I live in UK Ive tried improvements in diet etc but Im not exactly a bad eater anyway exercise is fine but doesnt really change anything just gives me something to do. Easily lose will to do it though. My socialising is obviously nonexistent and I try to encourage girlfriend to do her own thing with friends in that respect. So in summary nothings changed Im in a state of status quo every plan I come up with I find a major flaw in I strongly doubt theres a way out I hate the way I look sound and feel and feel I should protect people from their own blinkered love. So sorry and hope you have more success.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Im not deluded enough to think people wouldnt care if someone close to them wasnt there anymore. People arent generally that heartless. However it doesnt mean they wouldnt be better off. Like a child who is removed from an unfit parent theyd cry and be upset and miss them but ultimately theyre better off. We all get over loss we dont as easily get over regret disappointment and missed opportunities. Only I hold people back. I agree I have nothing to really complain about I almost wish I did as then itd explain it. I just cant cope with society I cant even talk to people on the phone or worry about what a stranger thinks of me. I just dont know what to do stubbornness stupidity anxiety stops me from doing things and every time I try to fight it I can only keep up the pretence for a while and then everything collapses. I just know Im right we seem scared to admit some people are just failures and not equipped. We could name loads of people in our lives we could say are useless or horrible etc but the second their is an element of affection for them is we decide to lie to them and ourselves ""theyre just unlucky/ need help/ have hidden talents"" I dont believe it. I have and if not struggling do still do a fair bit of exercise. Cycling jogging etc but fitness has never really helped. In my 20s particularly I was extremely fit but it didnt help. When I said way I look I meant more appearance than shape. I do appreciate responses but worry there is no hope. Maybe I cant hear it even if there is...."
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,I smiled at that last comment my girlfriend says Im too nice. Its a idea I struggle with (how can someone be too nice?) but she says people just take advantage or walk all over me. Id bend over backwards to help a stranger even if it detrimented me which is possibly part and parcel of the worrying about what others think element. So whilst on here I may come across ungrateful I can assure you Im not really this is perhaps my selfish place. Ive tried to be very thankful for all the responses on here I just struggle to see any benefit in it. You cant say you have a hidden talent and then not say what it is thats just mean...! Good for you though. Genuinely. However some people are just bang on average Im one of those. Im not in some deluded spiral that makes me think Im the worst at anything or have a difficult hand or anything Im just realistic and know I like many others are just bang on average but if I do dip one way its always the worse than average way. Its my head that beats me up for my limitations and stops me just fuctioning its hard to explain so Ill stop! Trying to think of good things is difficult for me I cant think of anything I cant put a negative slant on! Maybe Im good at arguing... But if I look at widely accepted sections of my life its not a good overall picture: Family fed up with me disappointed and feel sorry for me on one hand. Have never really included me anyway (but maybe thats my withdrawal tendancies) Love Life good and yet that makes it bad! If I didnt care about her Id be quite happy taking advantage but if you love someone you dont want to hurt them in any way emotionally financially future etc. If you love them let them go as the saying goes... Financially was poor sorted with job would be cleared up in a few years (credit) but dont struggle day to day at all as girlfriend is very successful. So Im just leaching... Friends if you can measure a person by their friends then Im zero. I mean zero not one person. My fault there fault it it doesnt really matter. Health other than this(!) ok really standard weight normal height dont smoke drink or do drugs. Eat reasonably healthily and do sport sporadically when its either sunny and/or I have a spark of inspiration. Tried routines lasted a week before a bad day threw it all off. Career down the pooper! Cant return to full time teaching know I cant do that. To stuck up for want of a better word to take a shop job knowing I trained to be a teacher. Also cant find another job that is term time only (to spend time with partner). Id struggle in ANY job anyway. Too overqualified for most things that might suit purpose. Supply is possibility but that means new people and stuff every day not my string point! Plus it means phone calls for availability and I cant talk on phone! Pathetic whinging excuse riddled crap eh? Not on benefits or anything as gf is on plentiful wage. Looks awful have the face of a teenager who cant grow even a hint of a moustache never mind a beard which means Im constantly asked for ID (or my parents if a knock at the door) despite being 34!!! People say you should be flattered but to me it feels like a kick in the face maybe its the bloke thing its like people telling you youre a child. I almost am a child... My facial skin is awful too no creams or regimes suggested by the girlfriend work so Ive just given up. Maybe Im an expert at giving up!! To be fair all things above have been tried for at least 6 months from drugs to therapy to face cream! I do appreciate your help/advice. I still wonder if its just character rather than depression. Maybe Im just a cynical boring lonely ugly loner. Thats fine when its just you a killer when you feel youre holding others back from a proper life.
illonashachar78@gmail.com,I am in restaurant with my friend but she is going home soon. I will be close to Your hotel in 15 minutes. I would like to say good bye to You. I will let You know when I will be outside Your hotel. And go out there ok?

dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Resisting the urge to get in to a theological debate... lets just agree to disagree. Sometimes I envy those with faith today I almost feel anger... Anyway my problem not yours. I hope things improve for youhopefully your faith gives you a bas e to work from and you turn around those feelings you have. If you believe what you have written then I feel you are closer than you think you are to accepting/being happy. Im as tired as Ive ever been. Tired bored and had enough. I can t even think of a positive thing to say. I think Im ready to sleep now.
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Wow thats great. Warm! I wanted to write super in Your language but I cant copy this signs from internet and put it here . Thx Because Polish language especialy pronunciacion is diffic ult so it is easy for us to say words in Your language. But You are quite good at Polish too Yes does Your grandmother sometimes speak polish with anybody or she doesnt have opportunities to use it?
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Yes I remember she is 90. Does she undersand a lot when she hear polish? Oh yes You told me that they were living in Rumunia but my mind was focused do much on Your grandmother from Poland that I forgot about the rest. ..... I am sorry
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Yes I feel it Meybe Your polish side live longer because Your grandmother and grandfather had so difficult live when they were young so they become stronger for everything. I know meybe it is a little stupid what I wrote. ...
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Let me start by saying I feel for you I really do. You have a GENUINE reason to feel like you do and should not feel bad or apologise for asking for help! You make me feel even more pathetic but thats my issue rather than yours!! Perspective makes me think even worse of myself as I know Im lucky compared to lots so why do I feel like this? As regards the drug route a lot of people have suggested this. However one major issue stops me and is not really ever talked about Im terrified of people/meetings etc! So I cant see a Doctor! When at my lowest I was being ferried around so had no choice and needed a Doctors note etc but now the thought of seeing a Doctor (or any body I know I have to talk to) terrifies me to the point Id almost have a panic attack. So not sure what to do there really! Still not convinced on the drug thing anyway it only made me slightly manic (obsessed with projects) and had no effect on my overall mood at all well other than making the idea of going seem even more rational. So instead of me whinging on and on let me just make a few completely uneducated comments regarding your situation. You dont seem depressed so much as tired! I dont mean that in a dismissive way but you clearly have a lot on your plate and I think (if there is any) you need some support. Id go as far as saying I doubt the drugs are halping you they seem to be treating a symptom not a cause. Did you have anxiety before all the pressures youre under? I think youd feel a hell of a lot better quicker if you directed your energy to finding financial and/or respite support if there is any. Youre probably doing too much and its impacting on your health physically and emotionally. If there isnt any further help then other than shaking your head at the hand youve been dealt then you seem to have a good plan of action at the moment. If that plan could be super organised to include you (as in time for yourself etc) and maybe incorporate a job (if you so wished) you may find you were in control a bit more. Im not trying to sound dismissive at all I promise! You have a compelling reason to feel the way you do and I acknowledge Im talking without all the facts. I just get the sense its a lack of control on a very hectic/ emotional draining life that is youre primary concern. For example if you won the lottery and could deal with all the bills and give the care to your daughter you wish do you think youd feel infinitely better? Youre depressed because of the situation I think so hopefully either you or you and others could plan a route that would help you considerably. I think there is a lot of hope for you to be VERY happy and enjoy your life with your daughter but youve just been struggling for years and its worn you down. Asking for help (other than medicinal) is the right way to go.
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Oh thats bad! This is not good explanation they should go to doctor! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! You remainded me sth : I read great book last month about one American Couple (70 old woman with Cancer and her 75 years old husband with Alzhaimer who escaped from hospital to travel in camper through 66 Road from East side of US to California (to Disneyland and Santa Monica where they met the first time ) and when they finished their trip and were sleeping in camper woman put their documents on the table started the engine and closed every windows in car ....... IT was wonderful book They reduced time of living but raised standard of living. I dont comment if she made good or wrong decision. I dont know why I shared this story with You but we were talking about old people and time of life so. .....
illonashachar78@gmail.com,I am fine thank You! Yes tomorrow is my first day and I am a l ittle stressed like always when I get new job. I am going to studying today . I was out yesterday evening with my new friend and her friends and we were playing billard so my weekend is ok What about You?
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Really ?? I know some people in poland who have it but almost everobody use messanger. Why do You need wattsap if You have messanger?
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Ok! I will let You know when I install watssap.... I am going to synagogue in the evening to take part in sightseeing trip and hebrew language lesson Today is special day when many tamples (other religious ) are open and there are organised special events inside What about You ?
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Hey Shavit best wishes because of 5778 year! How do You celebrate it? Arent You working these 2 days ? I was in synagogue and saw a part of shabat but didnt take part in hebrew lesson because I didnt feel good (I was cold )
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Hi Shav thank You I thought about You too !!! Yes I have good time in Warsaw. I am reading great book today (reportage about Israel people ).... Where was this picture taken (I mean new photo which You put on facebook today ) ?
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Wow thats great I thought it is Poland on picture because it l ooks familiar !!! I will write to You later because I am working no w. Have a nice day
illonashachar78@gmail.com,hey Shavit oh You went to sleep I will write to You another evening when You will be available. I can write to You only when I am home (using messanger on my computer) because my telephone is broken and I cant write long messages on telephone.... Good night
illonashachar78@gmail.com,hey Shavit are U going to be in israel 1925/27.04 .? Would it be good time for u to meet with me ? i am not asking about hosting me (i know it is it is too early to ask about it ! ). ...
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Please dont be sorry very aware thats my issue not yours! You sound like you have a very clear plan you almost sound excited! Im sure you are but if youre not do but make that your focus and you may feel the clouds lift quite a lot! I envy that purpose or goal or action plan I cant think of any! I think my girlfriend might stay with someone she felt sorry for like a responsibility for so to speak. I think she WOULD be sad if I left but shed be happy again a lot sooner than having to live with me! Its quite analytical I recognise that but to me Id rather her be sad for a year with loss rather than sad for 20 years with me! Its weighing up value short term pain for long term gain... As for a job my head stops me I feel I can do most jobs but only temporarily as my head messes me up messes my professional relationships up and I just cant see how I can hold down a job its hard to explain but being sociable (like you have to be at work) is almost physically draining and eventually my energy runs out and I drop all the balls Im juggling. You may be right about reason for depression but the genetic one concerns me most that means Ill never be fixed... Id rather just give up now. Ordinary to me is depressing. Ordinary is forgetable ordinary is boring ordinary doesnt exist. To give you a glimpse of my thinking the popular kids in school were exceptional but even the bullied kids had something about them. When youre average youre invisible. You can take the (friendly) mick out of someone whos bad at something you can admire the talent of someone whos great at something but when someone is average its just a shrug no story move on. Im genuinely the most forgettable man in the world! Im one of a large group of siblings Im one forgotten in family dos I was one forgotten at school (old teacher remembered all siblings during catch up chat to parents bar me) Im one forgotten at work I really am a waste of space! The medias main fault is trying to make people believe that happy endings exist that we all have a hidden talent and if you want something enough then it magically comes true. Sorry my view is very much it doesnt! It doesnt all work out in the end and were just fed this fantasy world that depresses us when the reality slaps us in the face! Sorry trying so hard not to just release on here....
illonashachar78@gmail.com,oh great... the flight tickets are sale now. I will buy it ok? ( even if You would be very busy this time it would be be nice to meet with You even one time....
illonashachar78@gmail.com,Yes I am still working in Warsaw but I will have 3 months of vacation from 15 Aprill Winter in Poland is not so cold this year ! more than 0 Celcius degree almost every day how are U?
illonashachar78@gmail.com,dont know yet but probably during my 3 months vacation. I am planning to spend about one week in Lisbon and go from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostella on foot ( 520 km people who are following this trail can sleep everyday in hostels for only 5 Euro ! )
illonashachar78@gmail.com,my telephones battery was dead.....70 years! great I will be happy to see how people in Israel celebrate it oh to be honest Poland in winter is not good idea I always feel I would like to escape from my country during winter I am going to Portugal at the beginning of may for about 3 weeks
illonashachar78@gmail.com,yes i hope it will be great.... I belive it must be amazing in India (U have to remember about vaccinations before going there it is so dirty ....... )
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Please do not get me wrong I do not believe any one characteristic makes someone of no value further more I think itd be impossible not to be of SOME value its just to what weighting you give a value when compared to all the problems it may cause. For example alcohol gives you a small boost but when abused can cause significant problems. For those with a problem it may be better to just give up the alcohol. I too have multiple issues with religion (thats a real rant!) but I dont think anyone has the right to judge another. I would never judge anyone else as worthless but I know myself and can judge myself. I stand by that judgement based on what I know what I do what I think and the proof I have. A person suffering from anorexia will ignore the scales reading too low a weight I suffer from no dilusions. Everything points to me being everything I think I am. You sound like a much better person than me you maintain strength in difficulty and have the fight in you to counter injustice. I can barely face people so volunteering is out of the question whether that is lazy or cowardly I simply cant pretend to be normal any more and public is so much energy. I am a faceless person on here. The reality of me is much worse.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,I care a lot about most people more than is healthy perhaps. I take on others problems if I can and feel more useful if Im helping someone else. Im often accused of making peoples decisions for them regarding me though although I dont see that as an issue if Im protecting them. For example I say I should leave gf to protect her she and family say its her decision to give up on me not mine. I still struggle a lot with that way of thinking. I feel you should protect people even from themselves sometimes. A reply after 8 months due to some shift.... bit more mundane Im afraid someone replied after a long time put effort in to their thread and I had an email telling me so I felt it was polite to respond! Sorry! Is holding back a strange metaphor?! :D But yeah maybe thats what it is in fact itd be easier to escape as I have no upper body strength at all! But its meant more in the way that if I struggle through on the low level I am my girlfriend will put up with it and not have the marrigate house holidays and have to basically look after me (phone calls sorting anything that invloves others avoiding social events to look after me) where as if I went shed be sad for a while perhaps never even forget but move on and get a proper boyfriend and get all that stuff. She didnt sign up for this she met the fake easygoing confident full time teacher with prospects...! Is there such thing as too much time on a computer?! I didnt realise! I filled in a survey the other day it said how long do you spend on the interent a day. I was strugling to find the all day option!
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"Its strange talking on the internet as you answer one comment but then someone else adds an extension question but all of it is stuff youve thought before. Does that make sense?! Another words whilst I offer my opinion on a particular though process it doesnt mean Ive not actually gone far beyond that in my own thinking. So to answer your very well thoughout view it is all stuff I have thought of before and almost counted out! Im just a whiner obviously If I did what I want Id be sportsman but then we have to be realistic and say that isnt going to bring in any wage! Besides I also know I struggle in team situations in reality as I struggle with the bravado that is especially prevalent in male sports. So what else do I enjoy genuinely nothing. But even I recognise that might be an extension of my apathy. Teaching is fun I love working with kids... but the other teachers parents Ofsted paperwork and most constant judgement of any career makes it impossible. On a side note if you have any issues with self confidence teaching is NOT the way to go! Ive never known a career in which youre so reguarly scutinised and theres always something you could have done better and if youre of a fragile nature you naturally only focus on that. No jobs dont have to be people based I too have worked in media as a journalist (although that is people based!) but cant think of anything Id enjoy or more pertinently be able to do skill time or wage wise! Setting up a cattery would be nice but need money for that. Being an architect always appealed by I have neither the time (course duration) or the skills to do it! Im not sure if this is normal or not I struggle with people but also struggle alone. Its not like once I have escaped people I feel relaxed. Maybe Im in a sydrome called grass is always greener! When left alone I am even more self destructive in my thoughts thinking time is not good time. I do appreciate you saying maybe there isnt anything you massively excel in its those kind of statements that make me think people are writing realistically rather than using a softly softly approach. Its not like negatives are the only reality but I can only begin to believe a statement if people acknowledge the bad. People saying ""Im sure youre good at x"" just makes me turn off someone saying ""Ok youre crap at that BUT try...."" is much more realistic. Unfortunately I havent found the good thing! I know that youd be better off is an extremely frustrating statement. The question is do you reveal what youre thinking or keep it to yourself? I always say be careful what you ask or you might not like the answer but if Im being asked to open up and not bottle feelings then where is the line on what is acceptable to share and what isnt? I cant help very strongly feeling that. I do think time heals and it seems logical to reduce any pain to its minimum a year or so after Im gone or a lifetime of regrets missed opportunities and struggles with me around. I cant do the whole marriage kids thing. I am next to useless when it comes to mortgages and luxuries. We all start with dreams of being rich and famous and having everything we want we then give up certain dreams as childhood subsides and reality kicks in as we get older we give up more and more dreams as we cant achieve them. But once youve given up every dream dont you just fade away? A very old person knows they will not travel the world again they know they can not look like a 30 year old movie star their wish may be to see a grandchild go to university or even simply to reach 100. But once youve done everything you can do or know you will ever do then to me it feels like its time to go. I tried the meds ok only once but it didnt work. I cant face going back to the doctors again and having to talk about all this. It feel so pathetic talking to a grown man about my piddly stupid head. Theres people going in there with proper problems or at least fixable ones! Am I afraid of death? Not really the thought of it is very much in my head. And I mean the actual thought not the before or the after the thought of that last breath then nothing. I dont think greatly of the drama of after a death (like oh people will miss me etc etc) I just am transfixed on the thought of that very last spark of the brain. It will come one day. Whilst Im very careful not to talk about suicide on here (gone or left being much friendlier terms) I know Id never make me passing traumatic for train divers dog walkers or unsuspecting family members. Bungeejumping skydiving or Vegas all sound great. But thats where the reality sets in how exactly am I paying for this?! If there was one thing that I think would have the greatest impact on my mental health itd be winning the lottery I could then distract myself with things or feel like I was providing for my family. Id still have those demons Id still avoid people Id still have no friends etc but instead of stewing Id be being kept busy on a beach in Hawaii! Money doesnt solve everything but it makes the low points easier to deal with as you can more readily escape. I do love travel that being said and when ever I can afford it I do. Im never going to feel differently to the way I do... thats as far as Im willing to agree with your last statement! Ive actually tried the big changes Ive tried doing the things that scare me or out of my comfort zone. I went to University alone along way away from family I travelled Europe camping for a summer I took on jobs I didnt think I could do I moved to new areas with no contacts. I think Ive done everything Im supposed to improve myself and my thinking. But none of it worked all of is (possibly selfinflicted) failed I always reverted to type. I appreciate everyone on here giving their time to convince me otherwise. I have never doubted there are very nice people in this world just as there are horrible ones. I do believe the horrible ones get a better life but thats a different conversation. But Im beginning to find that me answering these views is just making me more sure Im right Im a hopeless case. Whether its depression anxiety personality whining my fault others fault luck or time it now kind of strikes me as irrelevant. Im at this destination there are no more stops."
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Kick away! Fair enough I dont do much at the moment. I occasionally do a little bit of exercising (jogging/cycling) but a grey cloud real or metaphorical quickly kills any energy I have! I dont think its the lack of doing anything that causes this however Im still better than when I was at work/ socialising but then if this is the best it gets... well. I have visitied the Doctor and for the record he was really nice. Very supportive in fact. But it didnt change the fact I felt stupid and as if I was wasting his and others time. I remember being really worked up about the fact our appointment slot was overunning because I felt like I was holiding up other people. But I did that because my girlfriend was with me at all times (and forced me!) and because I needed to get a Doctors note for work. Now I no longer work I no longer need to waste peoples time. But youre right Im an expert in giving up! The girlfriend question comment is a difficult one and the one I battle every day more than anything else. If I leave her there is nowhere to go that really is it. I mean that in the practical sense here house etc but also it means that really is the end. I stay through her appeals and for maybe that ounce of hope that she and others are right that itll pass. Although Ive always been like this. Im not staying with her for ease or to string her along but leaving her really is a final decision I have no belief there is something better than her. Probably makes no sense. The 1% hope keeps me alive therefore the 1% keeps me here. If I lose the here I have absolutely zero interest in the alive. I really do appreciate your replies a constructive kick is better than a compassionate hug for me. But I cant find that kick that I cant talk my way around or explain away. I hate my head! I have actually tried everything Im supposed to maybe not for long enough but Ive seen zero difference. Leaving work calmed me down and made me able to uncurl from a ball but does that mean I can never return to a job? That then creates different problems emotionally and financially. I saw the CBT guy but nice as he was he tried a religious route with me (never going to work) and I put on my fake chatty character for the hour even if I was tired afterwards. It didnt do anything. Even if I try to get refered again by the Doctor Id actually be scared that Id be seeing him again or be seen to have asked not for him and although Im fairly sure he wouldnt care it genuinely freaks me out! How messed up is that?! Im actually ok if I prepare well for an hour or so around people I can seem easy going and chatty any longer than that and it gets difficult. If I cant prepare i.e. I know there will be questions Im not expecting or its someone I feel who will judge me e.g. a car mechanic as a guy then I cant do it. How silly is this I still get uneasy surrounded by teenage girls! Im not in the remotest bit interested in them obviously but just the feeling of inadequacy/ that Im a loser makes me feel weird. Same with family there is a duration before it gets too personal I can feel myself being overly happy and lively around them as if its all pouring out on first meeting them but that there is a finite amount and then my energy drops and I disappear. Grrr.... Im whining again. Shoot me.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,No the intent of this guide isnt a howto or strategy guide. My intent is to build an index of all the great information that available on pet battling that is currently scattered across sites and posts and condense it to one location. Im hoping to keep this fairly uptodate as best I can. If you spot that Ive got some information incorrect some information is missing or you have some information/link/macro/addon youd like to share please let me know in the comments and I will update.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,Pet battles are one of the features Blizzard introduced with the Mists of Pandaria expansion for WoW. Currently theyre minigames within the game intended as an alternative action or for when theres downtime in the game. As there are really no rewards outside of petbattle rewards (more pets achievements titles pet battle supplies) they are not an alternative to gearing up your character.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,You need to have a character that is level 5 and have 10 gold. You also need to have a full account pet battles will not work on starter/free to play accounts. If you meet the requirements head to a Pet Battle trainer to learn. Once youve learned the skill a couple of things will happen. Youll get a series of basic quests from the trainer which will teach you the basics of pet battling and youll notice little green paws on your minimap. Those paws represent pets you can battle with. You can select to track pet battles with the same minimap button you use to track everything in game.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,Ten gold is too much for new characters! Its supposed to be. Blizzard added the pet battle system as a minigame for experienced players. New players should be focused on learning to play the game. However with the recent hotfix reducing training from 100g to 10g this should be available much sooner for new players.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,Right now the total pet cap is 1000. However if you came into MoP with more than the cap your extra pets are still there you just cant catch additional pets. Once you dip below the cap you can catch new pets. In Legion completing a series of World Quests will reward players with an item the Pocket Pet Portal will only exist as a single copy in your pet journal.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,You may already have a pet collection and have all you need to get started. However if youre brand new and are starting with nothing you have several options. The Pet Trainer who taught you how to battle will also sell you a pet based on your starting race. You can visit any of the pet vendors in game to purchase additional pets the Guild Page and Herald and the Argent Squire/Gruntling are ineligible for pet battles. These guys are just for looking pretty while following you around.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,What do you mean caging pets? Currently some pets are able to be put into a cage. Wild battle pets are currently unable to be caged. In addition BoA pets (such as the Blizzard store pets) pets from achievements (such as Nuts) pets that grant achievements (such as the Spirit of Competition) and pets from some quests (such as the Singing Sunflower and Northrend Childrens Week orphan s) are also unable to be caged. Vendor pets (such as the Cornish Rex cat) dropped pets (such as the Emerald Whelpling) and some quest pets (such as the Azeroth and Outland Childrens Week rewards) are able to be caged. The best way to be tell for sure if your pet can be caged is to rightclick on it in the Pet Journal. If it can be caged youll see that as an option. Once a pet is caged it becomes an item in your inventory that you can trade or sell as normal.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,What if I want to get rid of a pet that cant be caged? Your only option is to release the pets. This is also ava ilable by rightclicking on a pet in your Pet Journal. There is no animation of the pet running free they merely disappear from your listed pets. Tho se more tenderhearted may find it hard to release some pets (Northrend orphans have nowhere else to go!) When I rightclick I also get the option to rename. What is that? After years of asking pet collectors have finally gotten the right to rename their pets. It does exactly what you think it does you can rename your Cornish Rex to Fluffy if you so desire. Pet naming follows pretty much the same set of rules as naming your character: nothing obscene/offensive no titles (such as Mr) and no linkers (such as The). You can put multiple capital letters and spaces into a pet name so youve got that goin g for you which is nice.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,What does the color around the pets portrait mean? Like gear battle pets have a quality associated with them. Currently theres poor
itaicohen266@gmail.com,What types of pet battles are there? Like much of the game Pet Battles have a PvE and a PvP component. PvE battles are those battles with wild pets or with the NPC Pet Tamers. This is the way if you want to collect pets and level them up. .
itaicohen266@gmail.com,Where should I go to find pet battles? Pretty much anywhere in the world. If youre just starting out youll want to level your pets along a similar zone path as a character. Lower level battle pets are found in lower level zones and progress slightly slower than character levels. For example Elwyn Forest and Stormwind have level 12 pets while Westfall has level 24 pets. Youll want to start in a zone that has pets appropriate to your pets levels. Quintessence and your revive pets ability.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"*How do I capture a wild pet? * You should have a trap icon on your pet battle bar. Once a wild pet gets below 35% health this icon will light up and you can attempt to capture the pet. Your chances of capture increase the lower the health of the wild pet. This becomes a delicate dance of you trying not to kill the pet while keeping your own pets alive. Having the Terrible Turnip or Molten Corgi as one of your capture pets makes this a little easier as these pets have an ability that will never kill. You can progress towards better traps by raising battle pets to level 25. The Pristine Trap is the best trap in game and is earned by completing the ""Pro Pet Crew"" achievement. The Draenic Trap which only works in Draenor is obtained by leveling your Garrison Pet Menagerie to level 2. Special note: occasionally in the wild youll see that an additional pet(s) has joined the battle. If youre looking to capture more pets pay attention to the quality of both pets youre fighting (the additional pets portrait will display smaller next to the pet youre currently fighting). You can only use a trap once per fight. Dont waste a trap on a lowerquality pet if theres a rare pet waiting in to battle (I learned that the hard way)."
itaicohen266@gmail.com,*Ive heard some pets only spawn in certain conditions. How do I know what pets and what the conditions are?* The Pet Journal has this information in it if you know what pet you are looking for . More discussion of the Breeds can be found in the Theorycrafting section.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"*How does pet XP work? What about my pets in a party? * Pets gain XP by fighting other pets (either in PvE battles vs. wild/tamer pets or in PvP battles against other PCs pets). XP is needed to advance your pets levels much like your characters need XP to level. Pets do not gain a rested XP bonus. Level 25 pets and pets that are 5+ levels above the enemy pet receive no experience for that battle although they do count when experience is split (as long as they are alive at the end of the battle). A ""difficulty bonus"" is given to pets that survive a battle under certain conditions. First if a pet is 2+ levels below the level of the enemy pet they generally receive the difficulty bonus. Also if a pet at or below the level of the enemy pets manages to solo a multipet team or 2 pets of equal or lower level take on a 3pet team they will receive a difficulty bonus. As of a hotfix to patch 5.1 level 25 pets no longer soak XP. Feel free to level lowbies with your 25s to your hearts content! *Whats the highest level my pets can reach?* Currently 25 is the max level a battle pet can reach. *My pet has reached level 10. How do I change what skills it can use in battle? * In the pet journal add the pet whose moves you want to change to your team (if they arent already on your current team). On their top abilities buttons you should see a little yellow downward pointing triangle. Click on that to select a different move."
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"*Any tips for leveling pets quickly?* Aside from following the pet tamer questline and battling wild pets there are a few tricks. One Pokemon standard is to start the fight with a lowlevel pet you wish to powerlevel against higher level pets. That pet must perform an action in order to credit merely having it out does not count. After your l owlevel pet has done its duty switch it out for a higher level pet and proceed to knock out the wild pet(s). Alternately swap in your lowlevel pet and then immediately swap it out (obviously need to time this just right in pet battles!). There are a few items ingame that will increase XP gain of battle pets. The Safari Hat obtained by completing the achievement ""Taming the World"" will increase XP gain of pets by 10%. Pet Treats will increase the XP gain by 50% for 1 hour and Lesser Pet Treats increase the XP gain by 25% for 1 hour. All the pet XP boosts stack. Pet Treats can drop from Tamer Bags or be purchased with either Celestial Coins at the Timeless Isle or with Pet Charms. Additionally periodically there will be ""Bonus Pet XP"" weeks in WoW where all pets XP gains are doubled. This is a fantastic time to level pets. Again all the XP boosts stack. Finally there are stones that increase levels (covered a little further down in this guide)."
itaicohen266@gmail.com,*My minor child and I share a battle.net account. Will we be able to pet battle each other?* Unfortunately at the current time Blizzard has made Pet Battles active on only ONE WoW account per battle.net account. While every WoW account will have access to Pet Battles .
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"*What are Pet Battles Stones?* Pet Battles Stones are an item added by Blizzard with patch 5.1 that enables you to upgrade the quality of your battle pet. Theres two types of stones: one which will upgrade the quality of pets and one that will upgrade the level of pets. Quality upgrades (Battle stones): Flawless Battle stones are rewarded for completing some pet quests can drop from some bosses can be present in tamer bags and are available for purchase with either Celestial Coins or Pet Charms. Theres also Polished Battle stones (but they only upgrade to uncommon and are pretty useless now). Leveling stones (Battletraining stones): Currently there are family specific stones (which drop from battles/tamer battles and are also available for purchase with Pet Charms) Flawless Battletraining stones (which are awarded for completing Menagerie pet quests and available for purchase with Pet Charms) and Feltouched BattleTraining Stones which award 5 pet levels and drop from the FelTouched Pet Supplies obtained by battling the legendary pets in Tanaan Jungle. *How do I obtain Pet Battles Stones?* There are several ways depending on the stone. Polished Battle Stones are sold by Commander Lo Ping in the Niuzao Temple in Townalong Steppes for 1000 JP. Again these merely upgrade a pet to uncommon and are pretty much a waste of JP. Do not buy these. You can purchase a Marked Flawless Battlestone for 3 Celestial Coins obtained from the Celestial Tournament on the Timeless Isle or at the Garrison Menagerie for 15 Pet Charms. Family Battletraining Stones are a *random* drop that you get from battling wild pets or Pet Tamers. Mostly wild pets will drop family specific stones but can drop the general purpose (need to confirm this). Also some pets seem to have identity confusion and may drop a different family stone. As of 5.4 you can turn 3 family specific stones (ex Flawless Beast Battle Stone) into one general purpose Flawless Battlestone. Family battletraining stones are also available for purchase at the Garrison Menagerie in the ""Mystery Bag"" for 2 pet charms (random which family(s) you get). Flawless Battletraining stones are also available at the Garrison for 3 pet charms. Additionally once a character has upgraded their Draenor garrison to level 3 they are given a quest outside their new Menagerie by either Lio the Lioness (Alliance) or Serrah (Horde) to find a stone outside their garrison mine. Completing this quest rewards the character with the ""Ultimate BattleTraining Stone"" which will level any battle pet to 25. This quest can be done on multiple characters. Currently Battle Stones *may* disappear from your inventory through the magic of CRZ. If this happens to you open a ticket to get it restored. *How do I use a Battle Stone?* To use one of these you need to summon the pet in question target it and then use the item. Clicking on the pet in the Pet Journal will not do anything."
itaicohen266@gmail.com,"Updated with new link. Shylir please check your email. Also back to the front! Question: has anyone put any thought into compiling a ""rare spawn"" information sticky with a listing of the pets that need special conditions to be caught (ie raining on the island for Baby Ape daytime for Little Black Ram winter for Snowy Owl etc)? I would love to but am finding that maintaining this thread is enough for me and I dont feel comfortable as I dont know enough (been too busy putting this thread together to level pets as much as I wanted oh the irony!)."
itaicohen266@gmail.com,First I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. I ended up having a fairly busy weekend. Unfortunately I do not have first hand knowledge about WoW accounts on the same b.net account. I have a trial account I could try out but I am currently at work without access. However its been reported that pets are b.net bound so they *should* be sharable. If you can you can test this by setting up a freetoplay/endless trial account and seeing if that account has access to your current pets. If this works RaF should work as well then. If theyre not there are several possible solutions depending on what Horde specific pets you need. Do you need just the Argent Gruntling Horde balloon and Horde guild pets? You can roll a DK on another server (since they start out at higher level) and do your thing to get the pets you need. Alternatively you can...pay to faction switch one of your current toons and find a Horde guild on your current server to fit your needs. Given the cost of RaF (base account + 2 months of game time) this would probably even out to cost the same. I know the above are not the answers youre looking for but they do exist as solutions. If you do figure out an answer please report back!
itaicohen266@gmail.com,I had seen Warlas thread. Unfortunately I didnt have time to check it out yesterday. I was thinking about it today and am in the process of attempting to look it over. If I dont get a chance to look at it before tonight Ill add a link to the thread at the very least. Also Im going to be on vacation for a few days so this thread wont be updated for a week or so. I promise when I come back Ill look things over and update things as needed.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,sorry for the delay in getting back to you. For putting together a synergistic team Id use the wowhead listing of pet abilities/companion listing (which may be time consuming) check out the warcraftpets forums or make a thread in this forum. I *think* Ive seen a thread about team synergy but it may be buried now. Hope this helps you out!
itaicohen266@gmail.com,sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

I *think* Ive seen a thread about team synergy but it may be buried now. Hope this helps you out!
itaicohen266@gmail.com,First you have to have a full version of the game (the endless trial account is not eligible). Second you have to have paid the 10 g to train for Pet Battles and completed the initial quests the trainer sends you on. Once youve completed that initial series of quests you can go anywhere in the world where little green paws show up on your minimap (the paws represent battle pets). During the battle with a wild battle pet once you knock that pet down to 35% health or lower (but dont knock them out completely) your cage icon should light up. Then its a matter of luck if the cage will actually capture the battle pet.
itaicohen266@gmail.com,Unrelated to your question: Timmain from ElfQuest? Answering your question: The Difficulty Bonus *should* be affecting the amount of XP you get. If your pets are 2 levels below the pets you are battling or take on 2 or 3 of the pets themselves they should be getting XP reflecting this bonus. When the battle is over and the XP flashes aboves each pets head it should have this bonus XP built in. For example Ill have one pet get 49 XP and the other pet get 194 XP with the difficulty bonus (note: that XP reflects the bonus xp being added in its not the typical XP plus that number). Keep in mind that the XP is still split amongst your surviving pets that participated in the battle. Are you not getting the proper amount of XP? Was it possible you were adding the numbers wrong? If you were reading the numbers correctly and your pets arent level 25 youre experiencing a bug and should open a ticket to report it.

itaicohen266@gmail.com,Without an Addon theres no easy way especially with low level pets. Youd need to know how the H/P/S numbers relate for each pet to each breed. For example a S/S breed Snail will not have the same speed stat as a S/S breed moth. With level 1 pets this is impossible because there is no real stat differetiation. Even addons will get the level 1 breeds incorrect. If you are serious about knowing breeds an addon is highly suggested. I dont think its possible to do it without an addon unless youre Rainman and/or have printouts for every pet with the numbers.

asafdavid08@gmail.com,So as many of you know I love my Switch. First and foremost its portability makes for a great gaming experience. That said Im not blind to some of its flaws. From its screen resolution to it horsepower to its mostly plastic build there are many areas where Nintendo could improve the Switch. With that said how soon before we see Nintendo roll out an updated Switch? And what changes do you expect or hope to see?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Most of us a pretty happy with last years phone purchase be it a Pixel iPhone Galaxy or something else. Yet try as they might no OEM can produce a truly perfect phone. As technology changes some compromise presents itself. And as consumers we accept some of these to get as close to perfect as possible. So when you examine that piece of glass and metal in your hand how would you improve it? Lets hear below.
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Welp....looks like Disney is gonna do it again. Black Panther. Infinity War. Solo. Incredibles 2. Wreak It Ralph 2. Ant Man and Wasp.... These films are gonna lead to another year of complete domination by the House of Mouse. I think the only film that may not see massive success is A Wrinkle in Time and maybe The Nutcracker. But well see. What Disney film are you most looking forward to?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Look.... I know things get dicey when we talk about ecosystems. Especially when they are between Apple and Google. This is especially true after reading the thread _silellak_ posted this past week or weekend. Reading through it now its as if people are suddenly audio experts. Can we be real honest for a moment? I dont need to have heard any of them to come to this conclusion: They all sound great with one maybe sounding a bit better than the others. Does it really matter though? The things that make them unique are their ability to use voice commands to do extra functions. If any of us are truly looking for superior sound arent going to buy a smartspeakers. Plain and simple. The Sonos Google Home Max or the Apple HomePod will put out audio that is truly beyond a fault. The real discussion should be the features. I hate to be the one to say this but are we simply arguing sound quality because Apple thinks thats whats most important? Or because the HomePod is lacking many features at launch? Regardless the HomePod will get more features as time goes on just like the Echo did. Its really just making me scratch my head how crazy this is getting...
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Well this escalated quickly. https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2018/01/17/reporterbehindansaristorycriticizeshlnhostslooksinscathingemail/amp/ For those who may not follow the link Ill try to paraphrase this: Mrs. Banfield was against the tone *NOT THE FACTS* revolving around the Aziz story written. She then voiced her opinions on air condemning the way the story was delivered. Again *not the facts.* Following that Katie Way the reporter at Babe.net decided to fire back. And she took some extremely low blows at Banfield namely taking aim at her age and looks. It was...sad. And certainly beneath one who claims to be a feminist. Now it makes me wonder how do those that support this article and its delivery those that say arguments against it are a mess feel knowing that authors other side?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So I dont need to tell any of you that theres been an extremely heighten awareness of sexual harassment especially in Hollywood. One thats *long* overdue. Yet something was bothering me and the latest claim against Aziz really brings up an issue: https://babe.net/2018/01/13/azizansari28355 I then read this article: https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/thehumiliationofazizansari/550541/ ....... I want to be completely honest. All the accounts in the #MeToo movement arent the same. And this particular story against Aziz is a bit of a tipping point that Im afraid may begin to hurt the entire movement. It seems as though we have people jumping on the symbolic bandwagon. While people should be fully held responsible for their foul assualting actions but what about inaction? During the Weinstein saga like many I was dumbfounded. How could so many women have been lead into these situations. Yet as I researched a bit more it turns out that many women now famous from their associations with Weinstein knew full well that other young aspiring actresses were walking into the same trap. And I think that disgusted me just as much. Why would you allow other women to be subjected to the same foul treatment? Certainly you would mention to your neighbors and friends if you knew a pedophile were lurking nearby! This is just as terrible. Turns out some women in Hollywood had indeed voiced their experiences but were mostly ignored. Yet the important part was that they had voiced it in the public! Some put out a warning. Again I want to be clear: This in no way brushes aside the actions of men who misuse their celebrity or power to gain what they want. But I can shake the feeling that standing there and taking it....is strange. And bordering on stupid. There are plenty of women around the world who simply wouldnt stand around for this behaviour. My sisters wife and numerous female friends are equally stunned by these situations. Going to meet strange men alone at night standing around while men masterbate in front of them... Why? Is your potential career more important than your dignity or respect? I dont believe any men is these forums would absolve another man of this behaviour. But those of you with daughters certainly youve trained your girls that this is unacceptable and they should immediately leave run or flee if they encounter unwanted sexual advances. My daughter is 4yrs old and my wife and I have already discussed and continue to discuss with her that no one should touch her in certain places. What decent parent hasnt? Yet what is happening when people grow older? Some obviously retain these lessons. Others seem to be ignoring it. Ive always believed that when a situation is in your control you need to take responsibility for what follows. Because in life there are going to be many instances where you dont have control. I may be rambling in some of this post. Maybe some of my thoughts arent being clearly communicated. But I want to hear the thoughts of others in this community. There are a variety of people here that differ from maybe those in my immediate circle. How do some of you feel about the entirety of the recent flood of accusations? Do you feel all are legimate? Are some just jumping on the bandwagon? Also do you feel that all the accusations leveled at those in power will remedy the situation? Could it backfire? Please....please keep this civil. I really want us to have a decent discussions that respects others opinions. *(Unless that opinion suggests that sexual harassment is okay. If so youre a piece of crap and dont bother commenting.)* Thanks.
asafdavid08@gmail.com,I now need a new tablet. Im simply not going to spend upwards of $300 for a screen replacement when I can spend just a bit more and get a new one. My first thought of course was just get another iPad. Perfectly reasonable assessment. The iPad is hands down the best *pure* tablet by a long shot. In fact outside of buying the failed Motorola Xoom at launch and promptly switching to the iPad 2 7 or so months later or the time I tried out a Surface 3 I havent seriously considered trying anything else. But things have now changed. I wanna try something different. After leaving behind my iPhone and Apple Watch and inserting myself back into Android now seems to be a great time to do so. The question is simply what to get. My options are the following: Windows 10 detectables or Chromebook 2n1s *(at least until some OEM unleashes a true Chrome OS tablet)* My budget is $600 lets hear your suggestions below. Lets go!
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Wow...just wow...This game is crazy. And huge. So freaking huge! Im 20 hours in and Im still getting lost on these Titans. Heres my breakdown of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. First this game is not for those who want something they can play in very small chunks. It is a pretty deep JRPG and requires/seizures your attention for long periods of time. To get the most from this title you must devote some time to learning its ins and outs. Over the course of the first 10+ hours youre going to have information feed to you. Most importantly those involving combat. Clicking through these tutoriorls because you think you understand will result in you promptly being destroyed by your enemies. The world of Alrest feels as though it is literally seeking your utter destruction for any and every failure. Time attacks incorrectly and you may leave your foe with just enough life to lay down a world of hurt upon you. Regarding combat: Its superb. The learning curve can be steep though. You have such a wealth of options at your diposal that it can overwhelm you. Elements weapons directional stances etc....your mind will be working overtime to figure out what your next step in battlefield should be and you dont have very long to decide. Xenoblade fights require you to be not just quick thinking but divisive. The HUD during combat is another aspect that can be a bit much. Especially if you were again the type of person to ignore the tutorials. It is information overload. Watch your parties health watch you characters auto attack timing watch you special abilities watch your enemies attacks watch for status changes in the enemies. Your eyes need to be trained to take this all in and be able to act upon it in an instance. The amount of damage you can deliver is huge if you are prepared. It can greatly reduced the amount of time your fighting an opponent. Combat is something that Xenoblade does very well. It makes you feel like a pro when you successfully bring down a for due to your skill. Something you dont always get from a game. Next up is exploration. As I mentioned earlier the world of Xenoblade is humongous! It makes the land of Hyrule in BotW look downright bleak and empty. Towns are full of people and feel alive with activity. So many shops to spend your money on to prepare for combat. Numerous NPCs to speak with to not only learn about this world but also whats happening in it and actually advancing its abilities to assist you later. Outside of the towns the landscape is simply beautiful. The areas vary greatly from lush jungles to sandy deserts. Branching paths usually reward you for simply exploring. But while the towns and landscapes are wonderful the guiding arrow to complete missions is borderline a deal breaker. Seriously this thing is useless unless your on a level area. Alrest is wide tall and full of nooks and crannies. If you arent up for looking behind every corner checking every hole youll miss you stop. My advice: You better listen to whoever is giving you an assignment because simply following the arrow at the top of the HUD will drive you insane. Finally the story. I wont spoil anything here but I will say that its very good so far. Probably not the deepest thing out there but certainly entertaining. Leans heavily into ideas and mannerisms found in many Japanese mangas. If you like those things you throughly enjoy yourself. To sum up Id say this game is certainly worth the price of admission. Zelda kicked off the Switch launch properly and Xenoblade is giving the huge assist to finish off Nintendos efforts in 2017. Xenoblade has kicked my tail to the point that sometimes I want to just put the controller down. But those times I successfully pull off a combo of epic proportions...it just reels me back in. So what do you all think of XC2? Lets discuss below!
asafdavid08@gmail.com,We live tech. We breath tech. We use tech. From gaming to vehicles to mobile tech is constantly moving and presenting us with either new things or improvements on things we already use. With that said what has been your best tech purchase in 2017? That single item that has truly enriched your life or been an absolute pleasure to use daily. Sound off below!
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Can we just take a moment and be honest? The DCEU is a mess plain and simple. I dont want this post to be a MCU vs DCEU debate. To be fair the MCU has plenty of issues of its own. There a few problems with continuity some of the films arent great villians are mostly forgettable etc. Despite these issues though the MCU has a common thread that has made its movies must watch for many especially the average moviegoer. The DCEU though...its problems are deeper than whats on the screen. From the producers directors screenwriters...If you cant get the situation right behind the camera how can you expect to put a good film on screen? Wonder Woman is a good/great film but its measured against its stablemates which helps it to look even better. Man of Steel was decent/good. Its problem was being _too_ dark for the coming out of a new Superman film. Suicide Squad was meh/decent. Problem here is we didnt need this film yet. Finally: Batman vs Superman was bad/meh. This film had way too many issues and even the most advent DC fan can see that especially when they compare it back to Wonder Woman. Having too many hands in the kitchen has wrecked the DCEU and the attempts to right the ship with Justice League doesnt seem to be helping a lot. Is it maybe time to just scrap whats on the table for Warner Bros and just restart? At least by going back to the beginning a single head can help churn out a consistent vision with none of the problems of trying to stitch together these previous films. DC characters are too well known to be saddled with such films. Superman Batman Wonder Woman all deserve better than this.
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Wow....just wow! The Switch has really come into its own this first year. Launching with BotW followed by Mario Odyssey was certainly a great plan. But now Nintendo intends to end the year on another high note: Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I cant state just how pleased I am with Nintendos efforts. Each of these games alone will fill weeks of your time if you spend the time exploring. Personally Ive always been a fan of single player campaigns so this lineup appeals to me but probably not to those who enjoy online play. Regardless I think Nintendo is a perfect compliment to either an X Box or Playstation owner. How do you feel about the Switch and its first year lineup? Confident they can continue to deliver the goods?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So the gist is that someone is going to remedy the saturation issue thats been plaguing the Pixel 2s display. Granted it doesnt address the more serious issues some users may be experiencing. Regardless for those like me with no major display problems this will be much appreciated. My single issue with my 2 XL is the muted colors. While I dont notice in normal usage too often...as soon as I see my 6P its obvious. Heres hoping this upcoming app helps!
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Could some of you who purchased an iPhone 8 please explain why you did so? I simply cant fathom why you wouldnt wait for the clearly superior iPhone: the iPhone X. It contains all the things that make a new phone exciting: new (though questionably ugly) design beautiful AMOLED screen more advanced cameras etc. Its the iPhone that is more forward thinking and helps push its competition. My personal opinion is that the iPhone 8 is simply a warmed over device that certainly doesnt deserve to have increased even slightly in price. And while the X is a bit too expensive I can at least understand and see legitimate changes. So why did you spend your money on the inferior iPhone and not wait for the clearly better one?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So lets see if we can pin down what the table stakes seem to be for our mobile phones: 1. Greatly reduced bezels. 2. Water proof. 3. AMOLED display. 4. Great camera. It would seem that if you have these things youre golden. The iPhone X Google Pixel 2 Galaxy Note8 and LG V30 seem to share these things in common. Now what about extras? 1. Wireless charging. 2. Headphone jack. While not table stakes they are important to many users. This is an area where only LG and Samsung have made a clear attempt to keep both. Sorry Apple and Google. You may miss a few sales omitting one or both of these. Finally: 1. Pricing. This is a point of contention. Spending nearly a grand on a phone is wild. I damned Apple for it and Samsung and Google dont get a pass. This is getting ridiculous. Plain and simple. *At least one can make a hefty profit reselling the iPhone X*. That said I can honestly say Im glad that we have such a great selection of phones this fall. Well continue to nitpick over minor things but regardless of which you pick you should be happy.
asafdavid08@gmail.com,The best way to retain customers in a product driven market like mobile is a strong or even mix of software hardware and services. Yet no company is quite there on all three. Apple lacks the strong foundation of services. Google is missing the hardware side and Microsoft is hurting in software. So which company has the longest way to go to complete the holy trifecta? Please offer your explanations below.
asafdavid08@gmail.com,The Razer is the first major phone to be acknowledged to use a 120Hz display. And the hands on from many sites seems to be extremely positive. The difference while not picked up on camera well seems to be immediately seen. So how soon before we see more mainstream OEMs take the plunge and give us these faster refresh rates on phones? With the push for everyone to use OLED this may take a bit longer than usual...but still. Think Samsung king of displays can pull it off?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So the gist is that someone is going to remedy the saturation issue thats been plaguing the Pixel 2s display. Granted it doesnt address the more serious issues some users may be experiencing. Regardless for those like me with no major display problems this will be much appreciated.

asafdavid08@gmail.com,Personally I have no need for cellular in my smartwatch. But Ill admit this: Apple has done this right with Series 3! Adding the antenna to the screen is actually genius. Please take note all Android Wear makers. Theres no need to add sensors and wireless bands in the watch band itself. People like to change their watchbands!
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Youre an Apple user. You have an iPhone iPad Apple Watch and a Mac (or some combination of these). Youre also locked into the ecosystem and it would be expensive to suddenly switch to another platform if you wanted to. Yet you feel as though at times youre missing out on features from other platforms such as Googles Android or Microsofts Windows. Granted the envy may not sway you to leave but you cant help but long for offerings from the other side. Whats missing from iOS and Mac OS that you would love to see Apple implement into its platform? It can be software or even hardware. Lets hear your thoughts about *ONLY* Apple below. Stay positive!
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Youre an Android user. You have dozens of options for your phone from dozens of OEMs a few semi options for a tablet maybe rocking an Android Wear device and heck you may even work from a Chrome OS laptop (or some combination of these). Youre also locked into the ecosystem and it would be expensive to suddenly switch to another platform if you wanted to. Yet you feel as though at times youre missing out on features from other platforms such as Apples platform or Microsofts Windows. Maybe some of that nice nearly seamless intergration. Whats missing from Android or even Chrome OS that you would love to see Google implement into its platform? It can be software or even hardware. Lets hear your thoughts about *ONLY* Google below. Stay positive!
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Check out this article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/chromeunboxed.com/googleevenewlaptoppatentchromebook/amp/ Now it brings up a lot of points regarding the Chromeboom Eve. But my focus is the design itself. It addresses the major flaw many 2n1s face: No one likes touching the letter keys when in tablet mode. It still boggles my mind that OEMs still make laptops that do this. Its a usability nightmare. Laptops are still generally heavier than your basic tablet or iPad. Why combine that extra weight with the feeling of pressing keys when youre holding the device in its alternate mode? So Google seems to be looking at a way around it but still leaving the keyboard attached. Granted both Google and Microsoft have tried different approaches to this. Theyve each created devices that separate the screen from the keyboard. But this still results in some compromises. The Surface Pro requires a kickstand and has stability issues when used on your lap. And the Pixel C was top heavy to an extent. In their defense though you could at least detach the Keyboards and flip them so as to not encounter the issues of most other 2n1s. Do you imagine that Google could pull off a relatively thin and light weight Chrome OS laptop as its designed in the patent? One that hides the keys beneath a cover hinge that also acts as a touch pad?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So should Apple go all in on using eye/facial recognition to supplant Touch ID do you believe theyll continue to attempt to embed a fingerprint sensor under the display? Honestly it wouldnt make much sense to me. A hands free solution thats followed up by a method that requires touching to unlock on a future device seems backwards. Once you move forward with a new technology like eye/facial recognition especially if its the primary source of security it would seem an admission of failure to say Hey Touch ID was really better...Lets just go back to that. What do you imagine Apple will do? Part of me wonders if theyll just add the sensor to the power button. As far as I know no major players in the US implement the fingerprint sensor there so to an extent it would be more or less unique to the iPhone. (Im fully aware Sony does this but they still disable that sensor in the US.) It also makes me wonder about the iPads future. Would future tablets implement the Face ID? Is Apple going to remove the button from it as well? Lets hear your thoughts below.
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Netflix. Hulu. Amazon Prime. HBO Go. Showtime. Crunchy Roll. Sling TV. YouTube Red...Etc. Hell now even Disney is jumping into the fray. Just how sustainable is this business? Theres no way people are going to continue to pay for numerous streaming services to get all their content. So what will the end result be? *1. Will some of these services join into one central service?* *2. Are some going to simply fail due to not having enough diversity of content?* *3. Or worse will we eventually be forced back into the archaic cable television model of old?* Honestly Im not gonna pay for more than 3 services. And I dont imagine many of you will either. If the idea was to keep people from pirating...Well this idea that every company and studio needing its own service is going to backfire very quickly.
asafdavid08@gmail.com,"Since its widely regarded as the best smartphone camera in what ways do you imagine Google can improve on its camera? Last years specs: 1/2.3"" 12MP CMOS sensor with 1.55m pixels F2.0 aperture AF with onsensor phase detection and laserassistance Dualtone LED flash 4K video at 30 fps 1080p slowmotion at 120fps 720p at 240fps Manual controls and Rawsupport with thirdparty camera apps Gyroscopebased video stabilization 8MP front camera 1/3.2"" sensor 1.4 m pixels F2.4 1080p video Unlimited cloud storage for fullresolution images and videos Now rumors suggest that Google isnt going to bother with dual cameras at this time. Which means they will no doubt put their full efforts into making the software do the heavy lifting. And if last years camera is the measurement stick then its easy to expect that Google could easily repeat its efforts. Lets here youre thoughts below."
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So how many of you are getting destroyed in the Trial of Swords? I think back to when I first started the game and how often I died. It honestly like starting from scratch again with this Trial. Seriously its comparable to All You Need Is Kill....Except Im not getting better at a fast enough rate. That said still having fun. I want that fully charged Master Sword!
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So far Im enjoying the beta on my iPad Pro 9.7. A few things Ive noticed so far: *Chrome is displaying the web address toward the right corner of the bar* *My display appears to be dimmer than normal* *Scrolling seems faster really wish I could see it on the newer iPads with the faster refresh displays* *No app crashes so far but Ive had some freeze up for a few moments* All in all I think this is going to be a huge relegation for iPad owners who wish for a bit more utility from the worlds best pure tablet. How has your experience been?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,I just want an open discussion about this topic as I didnt immediately see one as of late. How do you feel about Americans choosing to travel to a country like North Korea? With the political climate being as it has been for quite a while should a persons sense of adventure be placed secondary to the possible risks that potentially come from a trip like this? Also what does one gain by visiting North Korea? Is being able to tout that youve gone to such a place really worthwhile considering the apparent risks? Lets hear your thoughts below.
asafdavid08@gmail.com,My heart wants to believe that all hype around WW is well deserved. To believe that it is actually a great summer blockbuster. I want to believe that this female directed film is good not just for being overseen by a woman but because much love and time was put into elevating the status of a strong female character. But...I just dont know. I cant help but to think back to all the hype the new Ghostbusters received and I become a bit jaded. So many articles were written on how fantastic the talent was for that movie. How that an all female cast would do so wonderfully and shut up all the haters. And then we got the film...And it was relatively a flop. And now we have WW. Its just too bad she has to carry the weight of 3 past films that have varied between alright (MoS) to okay (Suicide Squad) to terrible (BvS). Thats a lot of pressure to be under...Even for the shoulders of one of comics strongest and most beloved characters. So heres hoping that WW suceeds where the other DC films have stumbled or in many cases completely fallen. What do you all think: Will Wonder Woman be a success or will this film echo Ghostbusters and further push back DCs movie universe?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,Currently I have the 42mm Aluminum Sport model. And while its been a great device I cant help but feel as though I want a larger device. But not for battery life. I simply like my watches on the larger size. I think a 48mm size option would suit me just fine. What do you all think? Are you happy with the current two sizes or would you like to see Apple give us an even larger 48mm or more size?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So I may be in the minority but Im buying this as I didnt own a Wii U at the time to play this game. Mario Kart has always been an extremely fun game to play with people actually in the room with you. And since the Switch comes with two controllers you can instantly pick up and play against any willing family member or friend. So are you buying MK8 today?
asafdavid08@gmail.com,So it appears that maybe were headed toward a future of Star Wars films where the Jedi Sith and the Force begin to take a back seat. Maybe Im just reading too much into the newest trailer but it makes me cringe. In my opinion Star Wars is nothing without force users those that use it for evil and those who stand against them. Its basically a generic space odyssey a poor mans Star Trek. Ive never watched a Star Wars film for bounty hunters galactic politics foot soldiers clad in white or anything else. Ive watched solely because of those champions of good wielding swords made of light and making use of an unknown mystic force against foes who on the surface appear to be evil. If Luke Skywalkers comment about the Jedi ending means that they are going to simply evolve than Im cool with that. But if it means that all connections to the Force are going out the window...Im done. I already had hostile feelings about The Force Awakens and its copy and paste method of apeing A New Hope. (Seriously Finn wouldve been a better Jedi character as his life experience of being a Storm Trooper was something we hadnt seen in film before. Weve already seen a lonely outcast character living on a desert planet rise to prominence ) Ending Force users would be a blow to my investment in Star Wars. But who knows...maybe Im jumping the gun. Maybe Im overthinking the context. I certainly hope so. What do you all think?
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,So youre an Indian person living in Russia speaking English... Thats bloomin impressive! But I still maintain you might find it tricky to express yourself in a personal way in a language other than your home one. However dont let me discourage you if you feel it is benefitting you in anyway. You sound slightly lonely but I imagine that is largely due to your personal circumstances and possibly a short term thing while you sort your education in medicine. Keep that goal in mind and the time will fly. Once youve qualified you will probably have a lot more choices and can then choose where to be. If youre going to these lengths to follow your profession then you clearly enjoy it so thats another thing that is good. Im sure you could find like minded people local to you if you looked. There are very few unique people in this world that you wouldnt have something in common with. But Im not sure if youve fully explained whats wrong whats making you unhappy. Imagine dragons are very good Mark Wahlberg not so much
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,I mean this with the greatest respect but would you not be better finding support in your native language? You sound like you have identified the issues that are causing your depression and sound like you may be able to talk through your fears and problems but Im concerned you may struggle to clearly express yourself if youre speaking in a foreign language. Dont get me wrong youre English is far better than my nonexistant Russian! I just think you need to be able to talk freely and that could be hard if English is not your first language.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,I love the way you write! It sounds really verbal! Very nice of you to sign up to reply. How weird is this though I didnt think I had paranoia but you almost sound like my little sister! I know youre not but in my head Im beginning to wonder whether I should write on here! I probably do have depression I acknowledge that. I think my personality might not help but I agree depression is likely. I have social anxiety I over think far too much I have mild symptoms of OCD I have some body issues I hide my trichotillomania well being male (face) and Im somewhat of a perfectionist or idealist if I could have done it better then it was crap. Genetically speaking there doesnt seem to be any history of it in my family. Because of the way my last job blew up my parents became more aware of the situation. Thats not to say they were completely blind to it but it became more of a discussion. My parents have both had depression due to work but were fine before and after the event that caused it (tribunals etc) but they dont really understand the lack of reason side of it. I shared with them for a while on both ups and downs but got the impression it was upsetting them so have largely stopped talking about it. I never mentioned suicide to them. Again due to the situation my older sister became aware and she too pressed a little but there is a limit you want to talk about things when all it does is upset people and they cant help you anyway. I have not talked about it with other family members. Im already known as the depressing one so I try to sound super happy when Im around family now. I was told that the reason Im at least subconciously left out in family gatherings is because Im quiet/ serious/ boring (actual terms!). Im aware theyd care if I wasnt here most people are genetically programmed to protect their kin but my absence would make no difference really. I now spend Xmas away from family Im fairly sure theyre happier for it! I hate being a chore. I love your statement about it being disgusting sweet s*t thats so very much my style even in the depths its very much black humour sarcasm etc struggle with sweet stuff! Outside my family there is just my girlfriend. That sounds extreme but its really not. I dont have a single other friend that is equally my fault. But I talk to no one from University days no ex colleagues etc. I know noone else. Partially I like it that way its easy and I dont feel like a burden on the other hand I feel like some of them could have fought to look after me they all gave up very easily. I know thats not fair. You shouldnt test your friends. But on the other hand if I really cared for someone and knew they were struggling emotionally Id put in a little more effort. I wasnt ever mean or snappy with them I just kind of disappeared. But its not their job to understand mental issues they have their own busy lives with their own problems. So I sometimes speak to my girlfriend less so these days though. When it all hit the fan I had no choice but to share everything with her not that it was brand new information of anything Ive been with her for a long time. But maybe the intensity of the feelings was new of the fact they were always there. But again theres very little she can do so why depress her. I dont want to see her cry because of me. So Ive largely stopped talking about things in a way that might give her the impression Im improving. Occasionally stuff slips out or I sarcastically mention leaving but I cover it well now. I still tell her to find someone else I cover it in a light/jokey way but although Im not stupid and I know she sees though it it is kind of an acceptable level of sharing. Youre right about social anxiety too. That I fully recognise. I care way more than I should or want to about others thoughts. Doesnt stop it though. I do analyse everything Ive said and done before and after events but I cant forget it really stupid example I still remember saying something that was taken the mick out of at school probably really mildly and that was about twenty five years ago! How the hell can I get over this when I still stew over stuff I said when I was 9?! Despite seeing every flaw in myself I dont take criticism well not in a grumpy way but in a defeatest way. If Im told a million things are good but this needs improving then it was an awful experience. I know that is both ridiculous and common but want it stop effecting me so much. In complete contrast I am very patient and forgiving of others Ill always see the other side of the argument and Ill happily give people as much time as they need. Im the epitomy of do as I say not as I do!. I know where Im going wrong I know my thought processes are messed up but I just dont know how to fix them. I cant think of many situations where Ive felt better than anyone else the closest I get it wondering why horrible people in this world are more likely to succeed stupidity is rewarded (TOWIE type) rudeness is applauded (Cowell) stabbing people in the back is relabled ambition and generous people get walked on and criminals win the lottery! Im really happy youve started to figure your life out. You sound very intelligent and in control. You also mentioned being in school so I suspect you are quite young for you to have such a good grip on your feelings and recognise triggers and mental health issues is quite impressive. Is it an avenue you have interest in? Im genuinely happy you have got such a grip on it early understanding it early may help you in the long run I dont know but I suspect the longer this is left the harder it is to undo the learning to hate yourself that is embedded in to you. Much like whe I used to teach the longer you left a mistake/misconception with a child the harder it was to unteach it so I just have 34 years to unteach myself! And youre definitely not my little sister are you?!
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Typical responces in themselves are not a bad thing but perhaps too generic for most people. However with limited information they are the only thing that can be given to you. I dont feel you can give up until youve tried. So youll need to talk to someone on here close to you a doctor or a therapist or someone. You need to gve them a lot of information. If youve done all that and still feel like giving up then I fully sympathise. Just try to avoid giving one line sentences as that is not sharing that is a call for help and youd be much better seeking moe immediate attention like the Samaritans etc (unless youre scared of phone calls like me!) I do symathise but you need to share and you need to try first.
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,"I and this thread are probably not the best avenue to seek answers. Its very much a give up thread the way its going! Start your own thread. Tell your story if you want writing it down can help clarify what areas of your life make you feel the way you do. You may have a reason when you just keep writing. Im not going to give you the easy answer and say ""Im sure youre amazing"" as I dont know you and thats just not realistic. I know nothing about you. However on these boards are a lot of clever kind insightful people so they would be much better placed to help you than me. I dont think us mutually agreeing how tiring life is will help either of us."
dvirnimrod84@gmail.com,Kick away! Fair enough I dont do much at the moment. I occasionally do a little bit of exercising (jogging/cycling) but a grey cloud real or metaphorical quickly kills any energy I have! I dont think its the lack of doing anything that causes this however Im still better than when I was at work/ socialising but then if this is the best it gets... well. I have visitied the Doctor and for the record he was really nice. Very supportive in fact. But it didnt change the fact I felt stupid and as if I was wasting his and others time. I remember being really worked up about the fact our appointment slot was overunning because I felt like I was holiding up other people. But I did that because my girlfriend was with me at all times (and forced me!) and because I needed to get a Doctors note for work. Now I no longer work I no longer need to waste peoples time. But youre right Im an expert in giving up! The girlfriend question comment is a difficult one and the one I battle every day more than anything else. If I leave her there is nowhere to go that really is it. I mean that in the practical sense here house etc but also it means that really is the end. I stay through her appeals and for maybe that ounce of hope that she and others are right that itll pass. Although Ive always been like this. Im not staying with her for ease or to string her along but leaving her really is a final decision I have no belief there is something better than her. Probably makes no sense. The 1% hope keeps me alive therefore the 1% keeps me here. If I lose the here I have absolutely zero interest in the alive. I really do appreciate your replies a constructive kick is better than a compassionate hug for me. But I cant find that kick that I cant talk my way around or explain away. I hate my head! I have actually tried everything Im supposed to maybe not for long enough but Ive seen zero difference. Leaving work calmed me down and made me able to uncurl from a ball but does that mean I can never return to a job? That then creates different problems emotionally and financially. I saw the CBT guy but nice as he was he tried a religious route with me (never going to work) and I put on my fake chatty character for the hour even if I was tired afterwards. It didnt do anything. Even if I try to get refered again by the Doctor Id actually be scared that Id be seeing him again or be seen to have asked not for him and although Im fairly sure he wouldnt care it genuinely freaks me out! How messed up is that?! Im actually ok if I prepare well for an hour or so around people I can seem easy going and chatty any longer than that and it gets difficult. If I cant prepare i.e. I know there will be questions Im not expecting or its someone I feel who will judge me e.g. a car mechanic as a guy then I cant do it. How silly is this I still get uneasy surrounded by teenage girls! Im not in the remotest bit interested in them obviously but just the feeling of inadequacy/ that Im a loser makes me feel weird. Same with family there is a duration before it gets too personal I can feel myself being overly happy and lively around them as if its all pouring out on first meeting them but that there is a finite amount and then my energy drops and I disappear. Grrr.... Im whining again. Shoot me.
